  <title>Space for Empathy</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Last month I went to my first DrupalCon in Nashville. I met a lot of interesting people, had good conversations, and had a hard time choosing from the record number of sessions. As the week went on, I noticed a theme kept coming up. It showed up in sessions on how to create a better admin and content editing experience, in sessions on accessibility and what it’s like to be a blind or deaf engineer, in conversations about helping first-time users enjoy the experience of using Drupal, and in debates about what Drupal will look like in the future. What if the thing that will give Drupal a competitive advantage and improve the admin experience is the same thing that will attract new users and create sites that are accessible for all?</p>

<p>The idea that kept surfacing during my week at DrupalCon was this: we need empathy. The Drupal community has excelled at solving complex engineering problems, and the next challenge we face is just as critical, though it requires us to think a little differently: how do we make space for empathy in our work and in our community?</p>

<h3 id="our-bias-is-our-blindspot">Our Bias is our Blindspot</h3>
<p>Sometimes we don’t need more complex solutions, we need thoughtful ones. Building websites is challenging. There’s never enough time or resources. It’s easy to stick with what’s known and what works. But sometimes what I know is limited, and only works for people who look and think like me. It’s easy to become insular and indifferent to the needs of others because it’s hard to make everyone happy, and thinking about the effort required to change can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>If someone told me, “It’s really hard to talk to people with accents, so I just avoid them,” I’d be shocked. But I know I’ve created sites and tools that are difficult—if not impossible—for people with disabilities to use. Arriving in Nashville, I knew enough about accessibility to know that I needed to learn more. So I dove in and attended every session I could.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/DrupalCon-Session.png" alt="DrupalCon Accessibility Session" /></p>
<p><span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>I kicked off my deep dive with Katherine Shaw and Fito Kahn’s awesome all day Drupal Accessibility training. Check out Katherine Shaw’s <a href="https://www.prometsource.com/team/katherine-shaw">great blog posts on accessibility.</a></span></p>

<h3 id="accessible-empathy">Accessible Empathy</h3>
<p>I learned that excuses like “accessibility is hard,” or “it doesn’t affect me because I’m not working on a government site” won’t get me off the hook. Accessible websites are now a part of the Americans with Disabilities Act. And any site that is not accessible to all users is liable. I met several engineers who are currently resolving warnings or navigating lawsuits for not meeting <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0 guidelines.</a></p>

<p>But it’s about much more than just changing processes to avoid a lawsuit. Listening to the Core Accessibility panel, I was humbled when it was pointed out that we labor over fixes for Internet Explorer, which can make up 2-3% of users. Meanwhile, <strong>12.6% of people in the US have disabilities (40.7 million people)</strong>, and accessibility can still be considered an edge case. Building a website that works for more users is not difficult, but it takes intention, a willingness to learn and <strong>empathy.</strong></p>

<p>I also learned that having empathy for all types of users doesn’t mean everything has to change immediately. During his talk about accessibility, Everett Zufelt said, “The best place to start? Anywhere. If you fix one button, your site is that much more accessible than it was before.” So I’m challenging myself to build things the right way the first time, drop bad habits and to refine best practices so I can create sites and tools that serve all types of users.</p>

<h3 id="inward-empathy">Inward Empathy</h3>
<p>For some of you reading this, the challenge might be that you have empathy for everyone in the room, <em>except yourself.</em> You take on multiple roles at work. You handle the backend and the frontend and design and project management. You say yes because you know you can do it and how will you get ahead if you don’t show how valuable you are by doing all of the things all the time? I get it. Now stop it.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/Relax.jpg" alt="RELAX" /></p>
<p><span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>“ ‘No’ might make them angry, but it will make you free.” –Nayyirah Waheed;  Photo credit: Clem Onojeghuo</span></p>

<p>You deserve empathy too, so be kind to yourself. Good boundaries will keep you fresh and sane. A well cared for version of you will help your team more than the stretched and exhausted one that’s running on too little sleep and too much caffeine.</p>

<p>Something that stood out to me in particular in sessions at DrupalCon was how people wouldn’t move over in their seats to make room and allow those in an already crowded session to sit comfortably in chairs instead of on the floor. People would have empty seats on either side, and not move down the row to make it easier others. There are people who don’t have an issue taking up space, taking what they need, and not for an instant feeling bad about it. Let’s find some balance somewhere in the middle. Give yourself the empathy you need to succeed, and–for the love of god–let’s all scoot down so no one is left sitting on the floor.</p>

<h3 id="outward-empathy">Outward Empathy</h3>
<p>A better admin experience, and faster and more accessible websites are only created when we think about how our work is used by everyone. Take a moment to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes. Now apologize for taking their shoes, sit down and talk to them about how they use your site, what the sticking points are, and how it can be improved. Most importantly, <strong>listen.</strong> Forget what you think you know, and learn about what it means to be someone else using your website. Then you just might have a week like mine where you were reminded: sometimes engineers are blind or deaf, or both. Sometimes keynotes are a she or a he or a they. Sometimes content editors know exactly what is needed to make a better editing experience–if you just ask.</p>

<h3 id="be-human-think-digital">Be Human. Think Digital.</h3>
<p>Empathy is what makes us human. We all want to be seen and known and understood. And at the end of the day we all want to use tools that help us to accomplish a task, not remind us that we’re not who the engineer had in mind. Technology without empathy is hollow. Empathy without technology is limited. Let’s make space for empathy in our community and in our code, and let’s change the world for good—for everyone.</p>

  <title>ThinkShout hits all the conferences</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>It unfolded like a sitcom. You know, the one where someone promises two separate people to be their date to the dance at school. It’s gonna end badly for everyone.</p>

<p>Well, we saw it coming, and like the hero of that sitcom, we concocted an elaborate scheme to be in two places at once. Can we pull it off? Join us at DrupalCon and #18NTC to find out!</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/zackmorris.gif" alt="Zack Morris" /></p>

<h3 id="ntc">NTC</h3>

<p>We’re heading to New Orleans for a week of jam-packed nonprofit goodness. The fun kicks off on April 10th with a pre-con event, Drupal Day:</p>

<p class="center"><a href="http://ntcdrupalday.org/">Agenda Here!</a></p>

<p>We’re still  looking for lightning talk speakers so <a href="mailto:natania.leclerc@thinkshout.com">contact us</a> if you have a hot topic you want to share. Lightning talks are traditionally 5 minutes in length, and can cover any topic ranging from Drupal to nonprofit life to lessons learned and funny predicaments involving all of the above!</p>

<p>Brett Meyer and Jessica Tate will also be dropping some knowledge during the conference itself. Mark your calendars so you don’t miss their talks:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nten.org/ntc/program/sessions/supporting-diversity-with-multicultural-design/?mc_cid=997b26a472&amp;mc_eid=[UNIQID]">Supporting Culture with Multicultural Design</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nten.org/ntc/program/sessions/content-strategy-in-popular-culture-2/?mc_cid=997b26a472&amp;mc_eid=[UNIQID]">Content Strategy in Popular Culture</a></p>

<p>And no NTC would be complete without some ThinkShout classic tees! We’ll be handing out these beauties at our booth (number 606). We went with a 70s-inspired design this year, and they’ll give you all the posi-vibes you need.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/TS2018-shirts.jpg" alt="ThinkShout 2018 shirts" /></p>

<h3 id="drupalcon">DrupalCon</h3>

<p>They said it couldn’t be done…so naturally we took on the challenge! A handful of our team will also be in Nashville for DrupalCon to learn about and contribute to the latest innovations in the Drupal ecosystem. As long-time supporters of Drupal, we felt it was important to continue to deepen our involvement and commitment to the open source community.</p>

<p>Join us for the <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/nonprofit-summit">Nonprofit Summit</a>, an interactive day of learning and networking with nonprofit leaders and Drupal experts. The summit features breakout sessions on a variety of topics – including a case study presented by Gabe Carleton-Barnes on <a href="https://thinkshout.com/bene/">Bene</a>, the distribution we released this winter. Don’t miss it!</p>

<p>We’re also sponsoring a <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/women-drupal">Women in Drupal</a> event on April 10th. All women, transgender individuals, those who identify outside of the gender binary, and allies are welcome. Our goal is to foster inclusivity and embrace the involvement of individuals across the gender spectrum. We’ll be handing out those same tees at both events, so be sure to show up early and grab yours while supplies last!</p>

<p>All joking about conference logistics aside, we truly appreciate every opportunity to connect with the nonprofit tech community. It’s a chance to hear more about the inspiring work being done in the world. If you’d like to sit with us and talk about what we can do for your digital presence, <a href="mailto:hello@thinkshout.com">let us know</a>, we look forward to hearing from you!</p>

  <title>Meet the ThinkShout Team at DrupalCon Baltimore</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>We’re packing our bags for Baltimore and polishing up our slide decks for DrupalCon! We’re so excited to join the Drupal community for a full week of Drupal-y things. We’ve got some great content planned for this year’s conference, and we’re very excited to share it with you all - here’s what you need to know:</p>

<h2 id="exhibit-hall">Exhibit Hall</h2>

<p>The ThinkShout Headquarters this year is <strong>booth 432</strong>! We’ll be giving away free t-shirts and raffling off an Amazon Echo. You can enter to win for the low, low price of one business card. If you have any questions about <a href="https://thinkshout.com/work/">our work</a>, current available <a href="https://thinkshout.com/careers/">job opportunities</a>, or what the <a href="https://isitraining.in/Portland">weather’s like in Portland</a> (spoiler: it’s probably raining), stop by - we’d love to chat with you!</p>

<h2 id="thinkshout-sessions">ThinkShout Sessions</h2>

<p>The ThinkShout team has two sessions in the DrupalCon agenda this year. We’re also very excited to be leading a discussion in our first DrupalCon Nonprofit Summit. Take a look at our lineup and mark your calendars</p>

<p>“<a href="https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/nonprofit-summit">Rapid Response Campaigns &amp; Digital Tools</a>” - Monday (4/24), 12:30 - 1:15pm, Nonprofit Summit</p>

<p>The news cycle doesn’t stop, and your website must help you respond to emergencies, not act as a barrier. Drupal can help you react quickly, in concert with your other channels, to turn current events into opportunities to spread your message and further your mission. In this breakout session, Brett Meyer and Lev Tsypin will talk about the tools you have at your disposal in Drupal, scenarios that call for rapid response solutions and how to implement them, and strategies that will help you turn these situations into lasting engagement with your constituents.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sessions/demystifying-rendered-content-drupal-8-twig-files">Demystifying Rendered Content in Drupal 8 Twig Files</a>” - Tuesday (4/25), 3:45 - 4:45pm</p>

<p>Amy Vaillancourt-Sals is going to show you the ins and outs of Twig! <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> is a robust and elegant template engine for PHP. It’s lightweight, fairly quick to pick up, very readable, and it grants users ultimate control over the markup, including wrapping elements and rendering exactly the output you need. In this session, you’ll learn about the debugging process of sorting through twig variables, using xdebug in PHPStorm, the other helpful debugging tools at your disposal, plus common patterns Amy found helpful for rendering content in twig files.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/sessions/content-strategy-popular-culture-part-deux">Content Strategy in Popular Culture, Part Deux</a>” - Thursday (4/27), 10:45 - 11:45am</p>

<p>Brett Meyer’s got a sequel to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJxtCPRde4k">his session from DrupalCon New Orleans</a>. Another year, another array of pop culture obsessions to examine and apply to the work we do. By exploring how crucial aspects of content strategy play out in movies, music, comic books, and video games, we’ll continue to expand the palette of language we can use to explain and convince more people about the importance of content strategy online, and ensure they understand that it’s not just vital, but fun as well.</p>

<h2 id="lets-chat">Let’s Chat</h2>

<p>If you’d like to schedule some time to chat with us in advance, drop us a line via our <a href="https://thinkshout.com/contact/">contact form</a>. We’d be happy to meet up with you in Baltimore!</p>

  <title>See You in the Big Easy</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Next week, nine of us will ship out to New Orleans for DrupalCon. As excited as we are to finally enjoy an authentic beignet and explore the French Quarter, the real draw here is the opportunity to once again catch up with our friends and collaborators in the Drupal community.</p>

<p>We’ve been hard at work preparing our presentations and lining up BoF schedules, and putting those finishing touches on our booth. All that’s missing is you! We have five short days to see what all DrupalCon has to offer, and meet everyone we want to meet. Can we do it? Two words: Challenge accepted.</p>

<p>As always, if you’re reading this and you plan on attending DrupalCon, too, we want to meet you! Here’s what we’ve got lined up.</p>

<p>This year, booth 216 is the ThinkShout headquarters! Rest assured, we brought the swag. Shirts, socks, and MailChimp hats await you, so be sure to stop by and grab one before they’re all gone! We’ll also be raffling off another BB-8. All you have to do is sign up for our newsletter by dropping off a business card. Painless, right?</p>

<p>We’ll also be on the lookout for folks interested in pursuing the <a href="https://thinkshout.com/careers/senior-software-engineer/">senior engineer position</a> we recently listed, so if you think you might be a good fit for the position and you’ll be at DrupalCon, then let’s chat! Drop us a line and we’ll set up a time to get to know each other a little better. Or just show up - that’s fine too.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/content-strategy-popular-culture">Content Strategy in Pop Culture</a>” - Wednesday (5/11), 1:00pm - 2:00pm</p>

<p>Join Brett Meyer for an unconventional look at content strategy through a pop culture lens. Draw parallels between the information you consume every day and the sites you build, and have a little fun while doing it!</p>

<p>“<a href="https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/story-successful-drupal-integrations-3-acts">The Story of Successful Drupal Integrations in 3 Acts</a>” - Thursday (5/12), 10:45am - 11:45am</p>

<p>Lev Tsypin will share the stories of the MailChimp, iATS Payments, and Salesforce Drupal integrations, and share some insight into how to be successful when setting out to integrate Drupal with other third party systems.</p>

<h2 id="birds-of-a-feather-bof-discussions">Birds of a Feather (BoF) Discussions</h2>

<p>Our team has three birds of a feather discussions planned on the Tuesday of DrupalCon, so mark your calendars and join the conversation!</p>

<p>Of course, we also plan on checking out the many wonderful social events that DrupalCon has in store in the evenings, so there’s a good chance you’ll see us there as well! It’s going to be a jam-packed week, and we can’t wait. As always, we’re looking forward to catching lots of sessions, brushing up on trends, and learning new things. We hope to see you there!</p>

<p>And finally, as we mentioned earlier, we’re excited about visiting LA this year because we’ll get a bit of face time with some of the great west coast clients and partners we’ve been working with over the last few years. We will be hosting a special happy hour reception celebrating these LA organizations and honoring one of our long-time clients and partners, the <a href="http://thinkshout.com/work/la-conservancy/">Los Angeles Conservancy</a>, with a donation from our team.</p>

<p>We hope to see you at DrupalCon this year. If you can’t make it, get in touch with us and we’ll fill you in on what you missed! You can also follow along on all the social networks: <a href="https://twitter.com/thinkshout">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThinkShout">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://instagram.com/thinkshout/">Instagram</a> - we’ll keep you posted!</p>

<p>To those of you heading down to LA, California or BUST!</p>
