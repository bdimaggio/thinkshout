  <title>A Tale of Two Devsigners</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>It’s June, which means <a href="http://www.devsignercon.com/">Devsigner</a> is just around the corner so, naturally, we’ve got design on the brain. What’s Devsigner? Well, I’m glad you asked. Devsigner is a conference held here in the Pacific Northwest geared towards front end developers and development-minded designers. Sessions focus on the relationship between design and web development, bridging the gap that separates the design from the code. The math looks like this: developer + designer = devsigner.</p>

<p>ThinkShout’s own devsigners <a href="http://thinkshout.com/team/josh/">Josh Riggs</a> (User Experience Lead) and <a href="http://thinkshout.com/team/eric/">Eric Paxton</a> (Front End Engineer), will be speaking at this conference at the end of the month. I sat down with Josh and Eric to learn a little bit more about their design process, and how we work with our nonprofit clients to ensure that their sites don’t just work, but that they also deliver a fantastic user experience.</p>

<p><strong><em>You two make up the dynamic design duo here at ThinkShout. What do your respective roles entail? How do you leverage your different skill sets?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: My role as the UX lead right now is handling all aspects of user experience and visual design. I’m responsible for interpreting site maps and requirements, plus things like client/user needs and creating a user interface out of that. That starts with wireframing and ends with a visual design layer.</p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: My role as Front End Engineer is very much in the implementation phase. Though I do advise in the discovery and budgeting phase, just so we can be sure that we can actually implement what the client wants. It’s nice because in the past, before joining the ThinkShout team, I’d done the whole gamut. From the requirements gathering phase to wireframing, and then the implementation. Here at ThinkShout, I’ve found my sweet spot. I do occasional wireframing, but I get to focus on lots of implementation. I also implement Josh’s designs. I write a lot of Javascript and <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/07/getting-started-with-sass-for-drupal-and-zen-part-ii/">Sass</a>, basically.</p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Eric is like the alchemist. He takes the metals - the designs from me - and turns them into websites. There is actually a large spectrum in between where my responsibilities stop and Eric’s begin. We still talk about things like, how do we go from an idea being on a screen, to that idea being a functioning website? We’re constantly thinking about how to best utilize our respective skillsets, always reevaluating our process to improve upon it.</p>

<p><strong><em>What’s a recent project that you’ve really enjoyed working on?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: <a href="http://selma.splcenter.org/">The SPLC (Southern Poverty Law Center) microsite</a>. I thought that was very well done. Josh did a lot of the front end work on that and I came in and did the site optimization, which is what I’ll be talking about at Devsigner. I thought that went really smoothly because at that time, all the work he’d done in the browser went directly to implementation. We were able to take exactly what he’d designed and <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2015/03/media-optimization-with-splc/">just build off of </a><a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2015/03/media-optimization-with-splc/">it</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/devsigner_0.png" alt="devsigner_0" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Can you talk a little bit about what the design process for the SPLC microsite was like, Josh?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: We happened to be working on that right around the same time as I was doing wireframes for the upcoming <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">SPLC</a> main site that we’re redesigning. We were already doing a lot of thinking about their content and what their needs were. Because the <a href="http://thinkshout.com/work/splc/selma/">Selma: Bridge to the Ballot</a> movie was coming out on the anniversary of the Selma March, we wanted to have this ready to go in time for that day. There was no way we were going to launch the whole SPLC site along with it - we were too early in development for that - so we decided to split that project up and give them a campaign microsite that would be easy to build while we continued to work on their main site.</p>

<p>A lot of that meant working with their team to define their content needs. I began with basic wireframes in <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>, and uploaded them into <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com">Invision</a> to give them interactivity. As SPLC came up with more fidelity to what their needs were, we solidified the visual designs. Luckily, they already had a lot of assets that their really great internal design team had created for the movie, so I was able to go off of that style. I took their visual style and applied it to the wireframes and at that point, I went to Eric for a consultation and said, “Ok, if we’re going to build this in <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/10/success-building-cmsless-production-sites-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a>, what’s the best way to do this as far as the architecture goes?” Eric was a huge help in regards to file structure. He wrote a great rake script to automate all the Jekyll, Sass, and Javascript components. That’s when I jumped in and rebuilt what I’d done in Sketch, and added more fidelity with HTML and Sass. I then passed it onto to Eric so he could do his unicorn magic.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/devsigner_1.png" alt="devsigner_1" /></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: And that’s a nice part about where our skills overlap: we can get closer to what we want. He’s a better designer than I am. My strengths lie in the code. I’ve designed when I had to, but it’s not my forte, so it’s nice to have Josh’s expertise. So these skill sets compliment each other. I feel comfortable handing over my implementation to design and saying, “Hey, can you polish the nav? Or the design?” Things like that.</p>

<p><strong><em>What design trends do you want to see more of? Or less of?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design">flat design</a> is getting boring. I’m starting to see a little bit more texture in the things we’ve done. Like patterns, not just flat design for the sake of flat design. There’s texture strategically used to make things look better. For instance, in the <a href="https://www.austinfoodbank.org/">Capital Area Food Bank of Texas</a> site, there’s a bit of a pattern in the footer. It’s not just a flat blue background with text. I really like patterns that are used to call out different sections of a design. It adds to it and brings something out of the page. It used to just be that admin interfaces were this flat. But now everything reflects that. Lots of rectangles. I personally like shapes and textures and patterns.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/devsigner_2.png" alt="devsigner_2" /></p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>:  It’s tricky to know when to add life to what’s a very flat trend right now. I come from the old school world of web design, which was about how cool can you make your shadows look in Photoshop, how three-dimensional can you make things appear. Now that’s kind of like wearing skinny jeans in the late nineties, when you wouldn’t be caught dead wearing them. Or neon colors. So I think what’s happening is that it’s not <em>just</em> that flat design is popular. If you look at other design mediums, like automotive or architecture, there’s a phase with extreme ornate elements. You know, crazy fins, details, lights, every car had a custom badge. All that stuff. And then you have the modern era after that where everything gets streamlined and simplified. It’s more about the function over the form, and the function drives the form. You see the opposite in the Victorian era. Go walk along the St. Johns bridge and look up at a lamp. You’ll see these ornate, twisted little embellishments along the lamps. But the purpose of a lamp is to provide light. Those embellishments do nothing to support the function. They’re just there to make it look pretty.</p>

<p>I think we’re seeing a lot of that in digital design as it matures. We’re getting rid of the stuff that doesn’t support the function and focusing more on the <em>intent</em> of the users. While we’re taking that ornate-ness out of it, we’re also adding a lot more micro-interactions and animations. Things that actually help you do what you’re there to do. At first, I was kind of against that. But now that I think about it as post-modern design for the web, it makes more sense to me.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do you advise nonprofits on this? Do these same trends benefit nonprofits as much as they do for-profits?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: I think knowing your end user is what determines your path. A lot of nonprofits have similar goals as for-profits when it comes to their websites - they’re trying to tell a story and engage their users. But the main thing is, do the organizational goals reflect what the user is coming there for? For instance, we work with the <a href="http://thinkshout.com/work/la-conservancy/">LA Conservancy</a>. They work to preserve historical buildings in LA. We didn’t just look at them, and then try to make their website look like a pretty building. But we also had this discussion in LA about form versus function. But I wonder, where does that meet in the middle? That’s what I struggle with. Because I do think there’s value in ornate elements like that. They set a mood. So I think that’s part of function - that ornateness sets the mood you want to present to your users to help them feel the connection to the organization’s cause.</p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Nearly every major design phase, whether it be automotive, architecture, art, whatever, there’s always a backlash to those current trends. So there will be backlash to flat web design. It may be a subculture, it may take over. But whenever something gets to be ubiquitous, there’s always someone who wants to do something totally different. It’ll be interesting to see what that is.</p>

<p><strong><em>I feel like that’s the nature of creativity… We see something, we make it part of our process, plus a spark of something new.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: We all have things we’re influenced by. To me, Google stands out. They’ve really led in the trends that people are using. There’s a level of depth to their designs that make me feel like I can reach out and grab it. It’s flat in some ways, but yeah, there’s definitely some depth.</p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, I think Google’s done a really great job. And you can see this happening in the app world. The current trend is also getting ubiquitous.</p>

<p><strong><em>Devsigner is at the end of the month and you both are leading your own sessions. Can you tell us a bit about them?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: My session is called “Optimization is User Experience.” I think this is something everybody can use, which is why it’s listed as a beginner talk. We learn web design, we learn app design, we release these things to the world where we don’t have control over devices and users’ bandwidth, so it’s important to know that this beautiful thing you’ve created can be experienced correctly regardless of what device it’s viewed on.</p>

<p><strong>Josh:</strong> So my session is based on something I’ve noticed. I worked on a lot of projects where there’s limited time, budget, or resources. Maybe there isn’t any resource for stock photography, or there’s just a really small team working on it. I’ve always had to find ways to be creative with what I have and with a small budget. I signed up to speak at <a href="http://rfrshpdx.org/">Refresh Portland</a> and I figured this might be a shared struggle and that other people could learn from my experience: how to stay under budget and still come up with a great, workable design. It’s called “Ballin’ on a Budget.”</p>

  <title>DrupalCon LA - A Designer's Perspective</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Oh, man. After coming back from DrupalCon Los Angeles with my team at ThinkShout, my brain still hurts… but in a good way. You know, in that same way you feel after binge watching Dr. Who on Netflix leading up to the season finale where The Doctor and Clara… oops. No spoilers. Point being: it’s a feeling of intense brain explosion followed by inspiration and motivation to get up and kick some ass.</p>

<p>Besides attending some fantastic design and UX sessions, I also presented my own session about <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/ballin-budget-how-create-great-design-without-breaking-bank">designing on a budget</a> and led a BoF about design and prototyping in Drupal. I made a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/feliarex">awesome</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jessemutz">new</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ACFind">friends</a> and reconnected with <a href="https://twitter.com/deviantintegral">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/blakehall">old</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/makangus">ones</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kevishie">as</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jponch">well</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great conference and LA was a fantastic host city. My team from ThinkShout and I covered a lot of ground - we found some great bars and restaurants, including my favorite stop, Grand Central Market (where I had an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/joshriggs/status/598967276163829761">octopus tostada</a> from La Tostaderia).</p>

<p>But anyway, you’re not here to read about bars and restaurants in LA. Let’s talk Design at DrupalCon.</p>

<p>One thing that’s really impressed me about DrupalCon is just how much the breadth of UX and Design content has expanded over the last few years. This was my fourth DrupalCon: my first was 2011 in Chicago, followed by ‘13 in Portland and ‘14 in Austin. I was excited to see there were several sessions in the UX and Design track this year that were less technical, and more about design thinking and problem solving. Personally, I enjoy these kind of talks because I tend to walk away with some new insights into my own process. <strong><em>Design is not the same thing as Front End Development, and DrupalCon is finally realizing and embracing this.</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/design_notes.jpg" alt="design_notes.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="common-design-themes-from-drupalcon-la">Common Design Themes from DrupalCon LA</h2>

<p>Attending DrupalCon is a great way to get your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the Drupal community. I’ve noticed a lot of changing trends in the years since my first DrupalCon, starting with the prevalence of responsive design. In the first DrupalCon session I gave in Portland in 2013, only about half the room raised their hands when I asked how many had worked on a responsive Drupal site. This year, nearly everyone raised their hand when I asked the same question. <strong><em>At this point, responsive design is implicit when designing a new Drupal site.</em></strong></p>

<p>Here are some other design and UX trends from this year’s DrupalCon:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People are applying design thinking about much more than how a website looks.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/meganerinmiller">Megan Erin Miller</a>, a designer at Stanford University, gave a fantastic talk about using Service Design to design <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/designing-end-end-experiences-why-we-need-service-experience-design">end-to-end experiences</a>. According to Erin, “designing a website is not just about designing good user experience. It’s about designing new processes, new identities, and new partnerships.” I couldn’t agree more. Erin compared the process of building a website to designing a theme park. When you go to a theme park, your experience isn’t just about what happens when you ride the roller coaster. A good theme park experience starts when you see an ad on TV or get an email offer and book your trip online or over the phone. When you get to the theme park, your whole experience is planned and designed, from the moment you walk in the gate, to when you queue up in line for the roller coaster, and on to dining and buying souvenirs. As designers, we should be thinking of our websites as products and how our users interact with these products from all possible channels, and not just what browser they’re using on what device. I’m always looking for new perspectives for my personal design process, and I hope to use some service design techniques in my client work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Components, components, and more components!</strong> Just as the topic of “responsive design” dominated DrupalCon’s design sessions in years past, this year’s hot topic was component-based design. As websites and web apps get more complex and responsive, design needs to be streamlined and simplified. One way we can do that is to design modularly. Gone are the days of creating unique layouts for every page on a website (phew!). Instead, we need to be creating design systems that can be applied efficiently across the entire responsive website. Two great component-based design sessions from DrupalCon LA were, “<a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/new-design-workflow">The New Design Workflow</a>,” and “<a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/pattern-lab-collaboration-using-modular-design-principles">To The Pattern Lab!</a>” In addition to these sessions, I also attended a very informative BoF about CSS Style Guides lead by the one and only <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnAlbin">John Albin Wilkins</a>. At ThinkShout, we already take a component-based approach to design, but I certainly learned some great new ideas and techniques!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Longform Storytelling is the new black.</strong> As Drupal shifts its focus towards publishing and news, content creators are embracing <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/styles-storytelling-cultivating-compelling-long-form-content">rich longform articles and stories</a>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Bjoran_Identity">Kristina Bjoran</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/circlish">Courtney Clark</a> of Forum One, “People generally learn more and remember more when more of their senses are engaged by a story. Stories that include images get about twice the engagement as text-only stories. Stories told with visual elements are instantly captivating. The more senses that are engaged, the more emotions will be engaged and the more memorable the experience will be.” We are including longform content features in many of our new client’s websites at ThinkShout, and it was really great to hear how other industry leaders do it successfully as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="design-drupal-and-the-future">Design, Drupal, and the Future</h2>

<p>Each year, the Drupal Association puts more thought into diversifying the session lineup, and it shows. There was a very conscious effort to get more design and UX content, as well as speakers from diverse experiences and backgrounds. To that, I say “Huzzah!” As someone who’s been designing Drupal sites for many years now, it’s great to see the design process being treated as more than just “making it look pretty.” Design and UX is now a core component of DrupalCon, and I’m proud to have helped along the way.</p>

<p>After a week of learning and sharing new ideas, meeting amazing people, and eating some darn good Mexican food, my brain is full and my heart is heavy. I can’t wait to see you all next year!</p>
