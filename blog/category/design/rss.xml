  <title>Designing for a Cause</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>In college, I was told time after time that we should always first try working for a small company. Allegedly, this is because you experience all of the aspects that make up a company; in other words, you are not confined to your sole area of work.</p>

<p>For me, this turned out to be true. Now that it’s two months into my internship, I can confirm that I learned something about everything from web design, to coding, to public speaking while working on <a href="http://give.thinkshout.com/">ThinkShout Cares</a>. This internship has been an amazing experience. I am not exaggerating when I say that what I learned in two and a half months is equivalent to a whole year of school… assuming that everything I learned in school would actually be useful (I’m looking at you, Geology 101).</p>

<p>As the web designer for <a href="https://thinkshout.com/blog/2017/08/thinkshout-cares-and-so-can-you/">ThinkShout Cares</a>, I was responsible for desinging a t-shirt and website that would fit nicely with <a href="http://pearmentor.org/">p:ear’s</a> message. You know, the shirt you <a href="http://give.thinkshout.com/#shop">probably ordered by now</a>… right?  I really enjoy the design process. It is a world of its own where you’re always learning. I think it is one of those professions where you have to reinvent yourself or you might not stick with it. I love the challenge it provides, as it energizes me to continually venture out of my comfort zone. For this project, I was challenged to create a shirt that people would like enough to want to buy.</p>

<p class="full"><img src="/assets/images/blog/ts_cares_1.png" alt="ts_cares_1.png" /></p>

<p>When looking at the past ThinkShout shirts (I’ve heard they are pretty popular at conferences), I was amazed at the beautiful typography and messaging in each of them. <a href="https://thinkshout.com/team/jessica/">Jessica Tate</a> (my manager) is an avid typologist who, beyond being an amazing UX designer, makes reading delightful and easy by perfectly matching fonts. Knowing this, I knew that I should probably stay in my lane and do what I do best: illustration.</p>

<p>The designer has the same job as the writer: to communicate something. However, the beauty of design is that you have the power to communicate widely and personally. I completely understand that today, the web is a behemoth. Intended or not, the surplus of media we consume is enough to make us slam the laptop closed and walk away.</p>

<p>I had to split my time between designing a shirt and the website where we’d sell it. To achieve harmony, I was careful not to let them differ too much visually. The shirt and the website are authentic on their own; they are related, but they aren’t siblings. They’re more like cousins.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ts_cares_2.png" alt="ts_cares_2.png" /></p>

<p>My goal was to create a serendipitous experience, something you did not expect, but you’re glad it happened. There are a few visual surprises throughout, connected by a theme. I chose the Universe as a theme because it is as beautiful as it is scary. I integrated hand drawn illustrations because there is an undoubtedly charismatic aspect about them. The more I drew, the more I discovered a sequence in my drawings. The top of the page marks the beginning of the sky. As you scroll down, you progress through the sky all the way down to the Portland skyline.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we need to slow down to appreciate web imagery; images often tells stories all on their own. When I was creating the t-shirt’s tropical pattern, I was unaware of how personal it was for me. In it, I was representing my home, a tropical town in Mexico on the coast of the Pacific Ocean where you see whales jump in the winter and you can find shells in the sand. For me, the beach is this place where you leave all of your worries behind and gorge yourself on the sun. It is one of the very few places where you actually stop and absorb the present. I am pretty content about how my design turned out. For me, the only thing missing there is a Ceviche. Too bad Ceviche isn’t aesthetically pleasing as the jumping whales.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the design as much as I do; it was such a fun process, and I’m especially happy that I was able to turn it into something that helps such an awesome organization like p:ear.</p>

  <title>What to Think About When You're Thinking About a Redesign</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Websites, like most things, have a lifespan. At first, they are new and shiny and aligned with both your organization’s goals and current web trends and best practices. As time goes on, however, technology continues to progress, and your organizational goals will probably evolve as well.</p>

<p>If you’ve worked through a full Discovery process to develop an information architecture that supports your organization’s core mission, then all you may need to update is the look and some of the site content. But if you haven’t engaged in an in-depth Discovery process before, you may find that your site is not only technically outdated, but also no longer reflects who you are as an organization.</p>

<p>So it’s time to think about a redesign. The good news is, starting your new project with a full Discovery will help you create a site structure that will serve your needs not just for the new version of the site, but for years to come. Additionally, if you build your new site on a widely-used and well-supported open source CMS platform (like Drupal or Wordpress), you won’t need to switch systems every couple of years. For example, Drupal 8, the latest version of Drupal, is expected to have a lifespan of 8-10 years.</p>

<p>Investing time and energy to develop a strong foundation now will set you up for success in the future. But how can you ensure your website redesign gets off to the right start?</p>

<p>Here at ThinkShout, we believe that technical excellence and award-worthy design should be a given, and that our focus should be on building you a site that helps you connect with your constituents and meet your goals. Through numerous discovery engagements with many different organizations, we’ve uncovered some key questions to ask during the initial requirements gathering phase that will help ensure the solution we create meets your needs and serves your mission.</p>

<p>Here are some things to think about when you’re thinking about a redesign:</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-organizational-goals">What are Your Organizational Goals?</h2>

<p>Before you dive into the specifics of your website, let’s take a step back and think at a higher level. Defining your organizational goals will help make sure that the solution you and your vendor create not only looks good and functions well, but will also support the fundamental mission of your organization.</p>

<p>So it’s important to take a moment to think about what your organization’s goals are. What issue are you working to address? What does success for your organization look like? The more specific and measurable these goals are, the better. Measuring your progress towards your higher level goals can help you assess the success of your project.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-project-goals">What are Your Project Goals?</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to zoom in and focus on this project itself. Project goals should be tangible, attainable, and measurable. They may include a mixture of internal goals (perhaps relating to how you are able to manage the website) and external goals (how your users interact with the website: engagement, donations, tracking, etc.).</p>

<p>It may be helpful when thinking about your project goals to determine how they relate to your organizational goals. Can you map your project goals to the organizational goals they support? If not, perhaps you should consider if that particular goal for the project is even necessary – or if it can be deprioritized.</p>

<p>For example, if your organization is a local animal shelter, one of your organizational goals may be to increase pet adoption. Website project goals that support this higher-level goal might be to post profiles for adoptable pets online, or allow facilitate adoptions through your website.</p>

<p>Identifying and then prioritizing your project goals may also help you define what success will look like for your redesign project. How will you measure progress towards these goals? Which goals need to be met for the project to be successful?</p>

<h2 id="who-are-your-audiences">Who are Your Audiences?</h2>

<p>A website only adds value for your organization if your audiences use it, and mostly people will come to your website looking for information, driven by their own needs and motivations. If you focus primarily on your goals, you may end up with a website that is geared towards your organization’s needs and structures, but that does not allow your users to easily access the information they seek.</p>

<p>Defining who your audiences are will allow you to put your users first when redesigning your website. Once you know who your audiences are, you can determine what content will satisfy their needs, sparking the trust that will allow you to nudge them to take an action beneficial to you.</p>

<p>These questions are just a starting place for your website redesign. A full discovery process will delve more deeply into your programs and departments, your needs and wants, and what makes your organization tick. But asking yourself these three questions before you start will help give you an anchor to help you ensure that your new website engages your users and supports your mission.</p>

  <title>User Journeys</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>There’s some talk out there about this thing called “User Journeys.” A user journey is defined as the experience that a person has when utilizing/interacting with something – typically software or a website’s design.</p>

<p>In more applicable terms, user journeys tell the story of an individual’s relationship with your organization over time, and across channels. Why are we talking about them? Because the process of mapping out a user journey can help you figure out how you fit into the lives of your users and identify gaps that are troublesome or disjointed in the user experience.</p>

<p>Some quick Google sleuthing will point you to various methods for developing a user journey. But the two primary options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analytical - looking at your site’s analytics to see where users came from, how they move through your site, and where drop-off points exist.</li>
  <li>Anecdotal - conducting interviews, or running a survey to allow people to share their experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditionally, ThinkShout has taken the analytical approach and we let the data guide much of our audience work. It’s safe to say that the majority of the time, this is sufficient for the needs of most organizations. However, some projects require additional research. There are instances in which you need to determine not only how people are interacting with your website as it stands today, but you might want to know how you could better serve your audiences and what new content you need to curate. You might need users to answer questions like: What would be helpful? What do you find frustrating? What were you looking for when you needed help? How could we improve to be the resource you turn to when you need it most?</p>

<p>As much as it pains me to say this (being the data-geek that I am), the answers to these question are not solely in the analytics. Most recently, we sought the answers to questions like this by conducting a series of phone interviews with site users.</p>

<h2 id="the-interview-process">The Interview Process</h2>

<p>While interviewing may come naturally to the likes of <a href="http://www.npr.org/people/2100593/terry-gross">Terry Gross</a>, for many of us, it’s an activity that requires a learned, delicate approach. Your phrasing and timing are hugely important, and it helps to be a natural listener. Sometimes, leaving space or an awkward silence for the interviewee to continue talking is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>ThinkShout spoke with an expert who gave us some pointers on how to phrase questions and assemble a matrix to guide the interview process itself. Using a guide is essential, as you’ll want to aim for consistency in your delivery/phrasing in each interview. But while consistency is important, you need to be open to taking the conversation in the direction the respondent takes you as well.</p>

<p>Your Matrix should be divided by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Research Objective - this is a combination of what your organization wants, but is also driven by what is important for your organization to learn</li>
  <li>Research Question - the question we want to know</li>
  <li>Survey 	Question - Open-ended, broad. This is the question you actually ask.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a research objective might be “unmet needs/opportunities.” A research question might be, “Does the respondent feel there is something missing in terms of resources or support on the site?” To make this a survey question (the one you actually ask the respondent), we’d phrase it as, “What would have been helpful to have early in your experience that was not available to you?”</p>

<p>You’ll want to interview several people from your target audiences to ensure there is sufficient representation. Generally, a small sample size is at about 8 interviews; a large sample would be 16.</p>

<p>After about 4-5 interviews, consistencies and common needs from your audience should start to surface, and you’ll develop a complete view of what their experience has been as well as what they’d like it to be.</p>

<h2 id="developing-the-journeys">Developing the Journeys</h2>

<p>User journeys weave together the actions visitors to your site take and shows the levels of engagement they have; in some cases (if you’re getting real fancy) they also include empathy maps and how they are feeling at each stage.</p>

<p>In one of our most recent projects, we wanted to show the multitude of ways in which a user engages with an organization, and their needs at each stage of the lifecycle with said organization. This also helped to develop the user personas, which are fictional representations of a type of user likely to visit the site.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/userjourneys1.jpg" alt="userjourneys1.jpg" /></p>
<p><span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>The first of several drafts of a Journey Map</span></p>

<p>Never has the non-linear path of an online user been more apparent than when we went through this exercise. In reality, there are countless ways someone could interact with your organization. We chose to focus our energies on the most common ones that surfaced in our interviews.</p>

<p>Then, we polished it up and incorporated the colors, fonts, and style tiles from the creative direction we had for the project.</p>

<p>Style tiles are like looking at swatches of paint for your house – it gives you and your stakeholders a good idea of what might go well together, but until you try it on your walls, might be hard to make a definitive choice.</p>

<p>By incorporating these colors into the user journey map, it helped solidify the creative direction for the site. We used certain colors for specific actions/stages in the journeys, and showed potential pathways with dotted lines, or a circle to connect various stages together. As a bonus, the designs of the journey maps hinted at what infographics might looks like if we were to take that path and design those for the organization as well.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/userjourneys2.png" alt="userjourneys2.png" class="center" /><span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>Final version of Journey Map</span></p>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>Through the interview and journey mapping process, we learned about resources outside of the website in question that were of use to our target audience. We were directed to other sites users found helpful or features that were valuable to them, which subsequently gave us ideas for how we could improve the site. We learned about their frustrations, but also gleaned specific information they felt would be helpful- details that don’t always come through in the analytics – especially when that content doesn’t exist yet on a site.</p>

<p>If you do decide to go this route and conduct interviews, a few items of note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start with an intro script to let the respondent know what they’re getting into and put the them at ease.</li>
  <li>Promise them confidentiality; or at least that you’ll contact them if you wish to utilize their responses and name publicly in any way. And hold true to that promise!</li>
</ul>

  <title>The Southern Poverty Law Center Gets Nominated for a Webby</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Have you heard the news? A ThinkShout-built site has been nominated for a <a href="http://webbyawards.com/">Webby</a>! And yes, it’s a Drupal site.</p>

<p>The nominated site is none other than <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Splcenter.org</a>, the online voice of the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization committed to teaching tolerance, battling institutionalized prejudice, and giving a voice to the most vulnerable people in our communities. Our partnership with the SPLC has been a source of great pride for us, as it’s led to an amazing collaboration for our respective teams.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center demonstrated its commitment to web excellence during the redesign process by investing in a platform that supports the vital work they do in the fight against injustice in our country, making it available and accessible to the people who need it most. This was an incredible undertaking, and I encourage you to check out our <a href="https://thinkshout.com/work/splc/">case study</a> on the journey to the relaunch of the SPLC to learn more about the process.</p>

<p>The Webbys are perhaps the most prestigious awards of their kind and simply being nominated is an honor. Splcenter.org is technically up for two awards in the “Websites - Law” category. The first is a Webby, chosen by the Webby Academy. The second is the People’s Voice Webby. While we can’t affect the outcome of the first award (beyond the work we put into making a great website), the community  decides the winner of the second. <a href="https://pv.webbyawards.com/2016/websites/general-website/law">Yes, you can help a great organization win by voting for the SPLC</a>!</p>

<p>The site is the product of countless hours of work and careful planning. We strove to build the SPLC a site that would further their mission and protect them from cyber attacks carried out by the forces of hate they combat every day. Together, we’ve accomplished these goals. We believe that work speaks for itself on the new site, but the improvement is measurable, too: since launch, we’ve tracked a 55% increase in overall traffic year-over-year, with a 120% increase in mobile traffic. From the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map">Hate Map</a> – which provides a highly accessible, albeit terrifying view of the rise of hate groups in the U.S. – to the sheer volume of civil rights news and resources made readily available and searchable from any page, the SPLC continues to expand its award-winning voice online. We’re asking you to contribute your vote and show the world that the SPLC deserves the People’s Voice award.</p>

<p><a href="https://pv.webbyawards.com/2016/websites/general-website/law">Please take a moment to cast your vote for the Southern Poverty Law Center</a>. With the Webby’s, your voice makes a difference, so please vote and be heard!</p>

  <title>The Evolution of a Logo</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>On my third day at ThinkShout, I casually (read: scared out of my mind) took a risk and asked what would happen if I suggested a few updates to the current ThinkShout logo.</p>

<p>I was met with encouragement, and was asked to build a presentation and pitch why I thought the logo should be updated. The key word is, of course: <em>why</em>. When we take risks, it helps to support that decision with understanding as to why the risk is worth taking - for both you, or your client’s sake.</p>

<p>When a lot of designers begin a brand refresh, they look towards the future for inspiration. I believe the past holds many answers, too. In this case, it reveals the heart of the company – and, of course, its brand equity.</p>

<p>So I began with the logo that was designed in 2012.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/logo_0.png" alt="logo_0.png" /></p>

<p>I’ve done a lot of detailed typographic work, so a few things stood out to me. Let me walk you through my process:</p>

<p>The first thing I did was look at the logo in black and white.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/logo_1.png" alt="logo_1.png" /></p>

<p>Turning any graphic to black and white helps reveal the details (and issues). Color likes to play tricks on our eyes and hide inconsistencies. I started with a high-level critique, to avoid getting distracted by the details and instead focus on the larger picture.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/logo_2.png" alt="logo_2.png" /></p>

<p>I saw a clear imbalance between ‘think’ and ‘shout.’ While the airy ‘think’ and bold ‘shout’ were originally intended in the first version of the logo, it resulted in too much weight on the right side. There is also some evidence that the logo might have been improperly stretched vertically based on the dot of the ‘i.’</p>

<p>Next, I dove into the details.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/logo_3.png" alt="logo_3.png" /></p>

<p>You may have to look really close to see what is going on here, but I’d like to draw attention to the three horizontal lines: the cap-height, x-height and baseline. Typographers use these lines to create consistent letterforms throughout a typeface. You’ll notice that the word ‘shout’ extends above the cap-height, the x-height and below the baseline. Typographically, this is wrong. It should be consistent with the word ‘think.’ There are few other inconsistencies throughout the wordmark that I’ve noted such as the line quality of the thought bubbles and the ‘o’ in ‘shout.’</p>

<p>After learning as much as I could about the existing logo, it was time to draw the new logo using Adobe Illustrator. (Remember, the past holds answers!) The screen recording below is about six hours of work compressed to a speedy five minutes.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="545" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tpYF-kxnSLM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>You’ll see in the screen capture that the first thing I did was set up guides and turn on grids. To draw the new wordmark, I used the pen and shape tool. Letters with a stem, defined by vertical stroke, were formed with rectangles; using shapes, like rectangles and circles, to build letters provides consistency and less room for error.</p>

<p>I spent quite a bit of time on the ‘h’, as I knew the shoulder – the little hump on the ‘h’ – would also inform the ‘n’ and ‘u.’ The ‘S’ was a beast on its own and was actually built off camera. Any typographer will tell you that an ‘s’ can take just as long as the entire wordmark combined.</p>

<p>When it came time to redraw the illustrations, I used the trusty shape tool again.</p>

<p>What you don’t see in the screen capture is the time I spent critiquing each and every letter with a great amount of detail. To do this, I printed out several variations and compared what I saw on screen versus what was on the paper. After several adjustments the new logo was born.</p>

<p>And finally the moment you’ve been waiting for… (drum roll, please!)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/logo_5.png" alt="logo_5.png" /></p>

<p>Ohhh, ahhh!</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at what changed.</p>

<p>Even if you can’t quite put your finger on why, hopefully the new version of the logo is more visually appealing. The ‘why’ is in the details. Probably the largest difference is the balance between ‘think’ and ‘shout.’ Creating a new version of the wordmark where ‘think’ is not thin and ‘shout’ is not bold means the wordmark feels more consistent throughout. The word ‘Shout’ is still orange – which naturally feels a bit stronger, according to color theory.</p>

<p>Another significant change is in the new illustrations. The new thought bubbles have character, but are constructed to feel like they are meant to belong together. Just those two things drastically change the overall feeling of the wordmark.</p>

<p>When we compare the old with the new, it’s easier to see these changes. Below, the red circles highlights several details that were updated with the new logo.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/logo_6.png" alt="logo_6.png" /></p>

<p>People often think a logo refresh ends with a new logo, but it’s really just the start. In most scenarios, the logo will need to be altered and formatted in ways that work for a variety of devices and applications.</p>

<p>So, I will leave you with the entire new ThinkShout logo family.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/logo_10.png" alt="logo_10.png" /></p>

<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project – and it may not have happened if I hadn’t spoken up during my first week. No matter what you do, don’t forget to take risks.</p>

  <title>How to Deal with a Small Design Budget</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><em>Originally Published by <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/small-design-budget/">InVision</a> on July 2, 2015</em></p>

<p>“I want my website to look like Apple.”</p>

<p>Ever heard a client say something like that during the early phase of a project?</p>

<p>What most people don’t realize is that companies like Apple employ huge design teams that work with nearly unlimited resources.</p>

<p>I spent several years working on these kinds of teams, never having to worry too much about budget. Now I work solely with progressive non-profit organizations that need to stick to a strict budget.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean the design has to suffer. Here are 5 things to keep in mind when you’re designing on a budget.</p>

<p><strong>1.  Focus on what you can do instead of what you can’t</strong></p>

<p>Even if you don’t have a team of 100 designers like Facebook, or the resources to create your own custom design framework like <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb</a>, you can still have amazing, creative ideas.</p>

<p>When time or budget is limited, I start out by clearly defining my limitations. And then I think critically about how I can creatively work around those limitations. Most of the time I’m able to create a solution that’s more innovative and useful than if I’d been given free reign.</p>

<p>No matter your budget, focus on these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>User needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good typography and color palettes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And you’ll design a good product.</p>

<p><strong>2. Don’t underestimate the implementation of your design work</strong></p>

<p>As designers, we need to know how our work impacts the entire development process—not just the budget we’ve set aside for design. I used to think that a minimal visual design equalled a simple design implementation by developers. As I got more experience, I realized that was wrong.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I wanted to add an expanding search box into the header of a responsive Drupal site we were creating at ThinkShout. It took me 2 minutes to design in Sketch, and maybe another 4 to find the code for the exact same interaction I wanted on <a href="http://codepen.io/912lab/pen/LsplC">codepen</a>.</p>

<p>So if it took me 6 minutes to design and find code, it must be easy for our front-end team to implement, right?</p>

<p>It took 1 of our front-end engineers 3 hours to theme in Drupal, largely because the expanding search interaction I wanted was so different than Drupal’s default search module.</p>

<p>Aside from spending years becoming an expert programmer, the best thing you can do to understand how your work impacts the rest of the development process is to be in constant communication with developers.</p>

<p>If I’m not sure about an idea or concept, I’ll ask a developer something like this: “On a scale of 1 to 10, how hard will it be to build this?”</p>

<p>Any higher than 5, and I change my idea.</p>

<p><strong>3. Be consistent</strong></p>

<p>When you’re building an app or website, inconsistency in design wastes time. Eliminate unnecessary, confusing, back-and-forth communication by making sure text headings, button styles, and image aspect ratios are all consistent throughout your design system.</p>

<p>For example, using several different image aspect ratios, like square for avatars, 16:9 for news stories, and maybe a 2.35:1 for very cinematic hero images might look awesome. But if your website is being built on a CMS like Drupal, someone will need to set up all those parameters in the back end—and that takes time to configure.</p>

<p>By simply deciding on a standard image aspect ratio of 16:9, you’ve cut the image configuration time by 2/3. And the overall design aesthetic won’t suffer a bit.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ballin_0.png" alt="ballin_0" /></p>

<p><em>The wireframe on the left has 3 different aspect ratios for news images, and the wireframe on the right has 1 standard aspect ratio.</em></p>

<p>The best way that I’ve found to keep my work consistent: with a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">component-based design approach</a>, and using <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/documentation/05-text/3-text-styles.html">Text Styles</a> and <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/documentation/07-symbols/">Symbols</a> when designing in Sketch.</p>

<p><strong>4. Focus on objectives, not deliverables or tools</strong></p>

<p>Design deliverables have to make both clients and developers happy. This isn’t easy—it’s a balancing act between creating enough work to properly inform the client, while also giving developers everything they need to do their jobs. Clients would love to see every possible page and interaction mocked up in high-fidelity at every break point with multiple variations. But most developers want you to give them an HTML and Sass component style guide and call it a day.</p>

<p>The reality: when you’re working with a limited design budget, you have to find a way to meet them both in the middle.</p>

<p>For me, having a solid design process is more effective than working through a checklist of specific deliverables. While the deliverables I work on and the tools I use vary greatly depending on the client—static or HTML wireframes, design in the browser, design in Sketch, style tiles, style guides, etc.—I actually have a pretty simple process. I always start broad before working down to the details. Style tiles before high-fidelity mockups. Sketching before coding up prototypes. Horse before the cart, and plenty of feedback in between.</p>

<p>With this kind of design process, independent from tools or deliverables, I can quickly and effectively adapt to any budget. How we think is more important than the tools we use to create.</p>

<p><strong>5. Communicate early and often</strong></p>

<p>Bad communication can be like a wrecking ball to your budget. On every project I’ve worked on, communication has been the deciding factor of success or failure.</p>

<p>It’s also been the main reason why a project comes in under or over budget.</p>

<p>So why does bad communication cost us?</p>

<p>Simple: assumptions cost money. Some examples of assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Something’s technically easy to implement when it’s actually not</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The client wants 1 thing when they really want something else</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can come back later and fix or tweak a feature</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Part of a good design process involves removing assumptions. When we assume instead of communicate, problems snowball. A little assumption in the beginning of the project can lead to big delays or hot fixes once we’re knee-deep in development. And as we all know, it’s much easier to change a wireframe than it is to change a feature in a deployed feature on a live website.</p>

<p>A typical web design project usually looks like the graphic below. Strategy, UX and visual design, and development all happen in large blocks of time, 1 after another. And in between these phases exist massive walls over which deliverables are thrown to the next person or group without much of an attempt at collaboration.</p>

<p>Besides being a bad environment for creating a great product, this can be a mega budget killer.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ballin_1.png" alt="ballin_1" /></p>

<p>The biggest problem with this kind of work environment is that it allows no room for us to iterate and solve problems as they arise. When we’re dealing with really complex content-managed websites, getting clarity can take weeks or months.</p>

<p>No matter how thorough we are with our UX and design, there’s always something that comes up in the development phase that needs our attention. Sometimes clients need change. Sometimes we just didn’t consider something, or we were just plain wrong.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ballin_2.png" alt="ballin_2" /></p>

<p>A better process: remove those walls we talked about earlier. If we rearrange our timeline so that design, strategy, and development happen somewhat simultaneously, and everyone communicates with each other along the way, there’s far less room for assumptions and miscommunications to rear their ugly heads.</p>

<p>Maybe you can’t completely change your company’s process, but you can at least start planning to save some of your design hours for the development and implementation phase of the project. Don’t be afraid to ask for clarity. Move your desk to sit next to an engineer if you have to.</p>

<p><em>“Every artist confronts a series of issues that are constraints. Those constraints are then turned by the artist into a positive force…”</em></p>

<p>–Frank Gehry</p>

<p>Working backwards from a budget doesn’t mean your design has to suffer. Use constraints as a challenge to be more creative and focus on delivering the core goals as elegantly as possible.</p>

  <title>A Tale of Two Devsigners</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>It’s June, which means <a href="http://www.devsignercon.com/">Devsigner</a> is just around the corner so, naturally, we’ve got design on the brain. What’s Devsigner? Well, I’m glad you asked. Devsigner is a conference held here in the Pacific Northwest geared towards front end developers and development-minded designers. Sessions focus on the relationship between design and web development, bridging the gap that separates the design from the code. The math looks like this: developer + designer = devsigner.</p>

<p>ThinkShout’s own devsigners <a href="http://thinkshout.com/team/josh/">Josh Riggs</a> (User Experience Lead) and <a href="http://thinkshout.com/team/eric/">Eric Paxton</a> (Front End Engineer), will be speaking at this conference at the end of the month. I sat down with Josh and Eric to learn a little bit more about their design process, and how we work with our nonprofit clients to ensure that their sites don’t just work, but that they also deliver a fantastic user experience.</p>

<p><strong><em>You two make up the dynamic design duo here at ThinkShout. What do your respective roles entail? How do you leverage your different skill sets?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: My role as the UX lead right now is handling all aspects of user experience and visual design. I’m responsible for interpreting site maps and requirements, plus things like client/user needs and creating a user interface out of that. That starts with wireframing and ends with a visual design layer.</p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: My role as Front End Engineer is very much in the implementation phase. Though I do advise in the discovery and budgeting phase, just so we can be sure that we can actually implement what the client wants. It’s nice because in the past, before joining the ThinkShout team, I’d done the whole gamut. From the requirements gathering phase to wireframing, and then the implementation. Here at ThinkShout, I’ve found my sweet spot. I do occasional wireframing, but I get to focus on lots of implementation. I also implement Josh’s designs. I write a lot of Javascript and <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/07/getting-started-with-sass-for-drupal-and-zen-part-ii/">Sass</a>, basically.</p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Eric is like the alchemist. He takes the metals - the designs from me - and turns them into websites. There is actually a large spectrum in between where my responsibilities stop and Eric’s begin. We still talk about things like, how do we go from an idea being on a screen, to that idea being a functioning website? We’re constantly thinking about how to best utilize our respective skillsets, always reevaluating our process to improve upon it.</p>

<p><strong><em>What’s a recent project that you’ve really enjoyed working on?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: <a href="http://selma.splcenter.org/">The SPLC (Southern Poverty Law Center) microsite</a>. I thought that was very well done. Josh did a lot of the front end work on that and I came in and did the site optimization, which is what I’ll be talking about at Devsigner. I thought that went really smoothly because at that time, all the work he’d done in the browser went directly to implementation. We were able to take exactly what he’d designed and <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2015/03/media-optimization-with-splc/">just build off of </a><a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2015/03/media-optimization-with-splc/">it</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/devsigner_0.png" alt="devsigner_0" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Can you talk a little bit about what the design process for the SPLC microsite was like, Josh?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: We happened to be working on that right around the same time as I was doing wireframes for the upcoming <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">SPLC</a> main site that we’re redesigning. We were already doing a lot of thinking about their content and what their needs were. Because the <a href="http://thinkshout.com/work/splc/selma/">Selma: Bridge to the Ballot</a> movie was coming out on the anniversary of the Selma March, we wanted to have this ready to go in time for that day. There was no way we were going to launch the whole SPLC site along with it - we were too early in development for that - so we decided to split that project up and give them a campaign microsite that would be easy to build while we continued to work on their main site.</p>

<p>A lot of that meant working with their team to define their content needs. I began with basic wireframes in <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>, and uploaded them into <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com">Invision</a> to give them interactivity. As SPLC came up with more fidelity to what their needs were, we solidified the visual designs. Luckily, they already had a lot of assets that their really great internal design team had created for the movie, so I was able to go off of that style. I took their visual style and applied it to the wireframes and at that point, I went to Eric for a consultation and said, “Ok, if we’re going to build this in <a href="http://thinkshout.com/blog/2014/10/success-building-cmsless-production-sites-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a>, what’s the best way to do this as far as the architecture goes?” Eric was a huge help in regards to file structure. He wrote a great rake script to automate all the Jekyll, Sass, and Javascript components. That’s when I jumped in and rebuilt what I’d done in Sketch, and added more fidelity with HTML and Sass. I then passed it onto to Eric so he could do his unicorn magic.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/devsigner_1.png" alt="devsigner_1" /></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: And that’s a nice part about where our skills overlap: we can get closer to what we want. He’s a better designer than I am. My strengths lie in the code. I’ve designed when I had to, but it’s not my forte, so it’s nice to have Josh’s expertise. So these skill sets compliment each other. I feel comfortable handing over my implementation to design and saying, “Hey, can you polish the nav? Or the design?” Things like that.</p>

<p><strong><em>What design trends do you want to see more of? Or less of?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design">flat design</a> is getting boring. I’m starting to see a little bit more texture in the things we’ve done. Like patterns, not just flat design for the sake of flat design. There’s texture strategically used to make things look better. For instance, in the <a href="https://www.austinfoodbank.org/">Capital Area Food Bank of Texas</a> site, there’s a bit of a pattern in the footer. It’s not just a flat blue background with text. I really like patterns that are used to call out different sections of a design. It adds to it and brings something out of the page. It used to just be that admin interfaces were this flat. But now everything reflects that. Lots of rectangles. I personally like shapes and textures and patterns.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/devsigner_2.png" alt="devsigner_2" /></p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>:  It’s tricky to know when to add life to what’s a very flat trend right now. I come from the old school world of web design, which was about how cool can you make your shadows look in Photoshop, how three-dimensional can you make things appear. Now that’s kind of like wearing skinny jeans in the late nineties, when you wouldn’t be caught dead wearing them. Or neon colors. So I think what’s happening is that it’s not <em>just</em> that flat design is popular. If you look at other design mediums, like automotive or architecture, there’s a phase with extreme ornate elements. You know, crazy fins, details, lights, every car had a custom badge. All that stuff. And then you have the modern era after that where everything gets streamlined and simplified. It’s more about the function over the form, and the function drives the form. You see the opposite in the Victorian era. Go walk along the St. Johns bridge and look up at a lamp. You’ll see these ornate, twisted little embellishments along the lamps. But the purpose of a lamp is to provide light. Those embellishments do nothing to support the function. They’re just there to make it look pretty.</p>

<p>I think we’re seeing a lot of that in digital design as it matures. We’re getting rid of the stuff that doesn’t support the function and focusing more on the <em>intent</em> of the users. While we’re taking that ornate-ness out of it, we’re also adding a lot more micro-interactions and animations. Things that actually help you do what you’re there to do. At first, I was kind of against that. But now that I think about it as post-modern design for the web, it makes more sense to me.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do you advise nonprofits on this? Do these same trends benefit nonprofits as much as they do for-profits?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: I think knowing your end user is what determines your path. A lot of nonprofits have similar goals as for-profits when it comes to their websites - they’re trying to tell a story and engage their users. But the main thing is, do the organizational goals reflect what the user is coming there for? For instance, we work with the <a href="http://thinkshout.com/work/la-conservancy/">LA Conservancy</a>. They work to preserve historical buildings in LA. We didn’t just look at them, and then try to make their website look like a pretty building. But we also had this discussion in LA about form versus function. But I wonder, where does that meet in the middle? That’s what I struggle with. Because I do think there’s value in ornate elements like that. They set a mood. So I think that’s part of function - that ornateness sets the mood you want to present to your users to help them feel the connection to the organization’s cause.</p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Nearly every major design phase, whether it be automotive, architecture, art, whatever, there’s always a backlash to those current trends. So there will be backlash to flat web design. It may be a subculture, it may take over. But whenever something gets to be ubiquitous, there’s always someone who wants to do something totally different. It’ll be interesting to see what that is.</p>

<p><strong><em>I feel like that’s the nature of creativity… We see something, we make it part of our process, plus a spark of something new.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: We all have things we’re influenced by. To me, Google stands out. They’ve really led in the trends that people are using. There’s a level of depth to their designs that make me feel like I can reach out and grab it. It’s flat in some ways, but yeah, there’s definitely some depth.</p>

<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, I think Google’s done a really great job. And you can see this happening in the app world. The current trend is also getting ubiquitous.</p>

<p><strong><em>Devsigner is at the end of the month and you both are leading your own sessions. Can you tell us a bit about them?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong>: My session is called “Optimization is User Experience.” I think this is something everybody can use, which is why it’s listed as a beginner talk. We learn web design, we learn app design, we release these things to the world where we don’t have control over devices and users’ bandwidth, so it’s important to know that this beautiful thing you’ve created can be experienced correctly regardless of what device it’s viewed on.</p>

<p><strong>Josh:</strong> So my session is based on something I’ve noticed. I worked on a lot of projects where there’s limited time, budget, or resources. Maybe there isn’t any resource for stock photography, or there’s just a really small team working on it. I’ve always had to find ways to be creative with what I have and with a small budget. I signed up to speak at <a href="http://rfrshpdx.org/">Refresh Portland</a> and I figured this might be a shared struggle and that other people could learn from my experience: how to stay under budget and still come up with a great, workable design. It’s called “Ballin’ on a Budget.”</p>

Come to <a href="http://www.devsignercon.com/">Devsigner</a>, which takes place during June 27-28 at the Pacific Northwest College of Art in Portland, Oregon.

  <title>DrupalCon LA - A Designer's Perspective</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Oh, man. After coming back from DrupalCon Los Angeles with my team at ThinkShout, my brain still hurts… but in a good way. You know, in that same way you feel after binge watching Dr. Who on Netflix leading up to the season finale where The Doctor and Clara… oops. No spoilers. Point being: it’s a feeling of intense brain explosion followed by inspiration and motivation to get up and kick some ass.</p>

<p>Besides attending some fantastic design and UX sessions, I also presented my own session about <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/ballin-budget-how-create-great-design-without-breaking-bank">designing on a budget</a> and led a BoF about design and prototyping in Drupal. I made a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/feliarex">awesome</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jessemutz">new</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ACFind">friends</a> and reconnected with <a href="https://twitter.com/deviantintegral">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/blakehall">old</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/makangus">ones</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kevishie">as</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jponch">well</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great conference and LA was a fantastic host city. My team from ThinkShout and I covered a lot of ground - we found some great bars and restaurants, including my favorite stop, Grand Central Market (where I had an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/joshriggs/status/598967276163829761">octopus tostada</a> from La Tostaderia).</p>

<p>But anyway, you’re not here to read about bars and restaurants in LA. Let’s talk Design at DrupalCon.</p>

<p>One thing that’s really impressed me about DrupalCon is just how much the breadth of UX and Design content has expanded over the last few years. This was my fourth DrupalCon: my first was 2011 in Chicago, followed by ‘13 in Portland and ‘14 in Austin. I was excited to see there were several sessions in the UX and Design track this year that were less technical, and more about design thinking and problem solving. Personally, I enjoy these kind of talks because I tend to walk away with some new insights into my own process. <strong><em>Design is not the same thing as Front End Development, and DrupalCon is finally realizing and embracing this.</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/design_notes.jpg" alt="design_notes.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="common-design-themes-from-drupalcon-la">Common Design Themes from DrupalCon LA</h2>

<p>Attending DrupalCon is a great way to get your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the Drupal community. I’ve noticed a lot of changing trends in the years since my first DrupalCon, starting with the prevalence of responsive design. In the first DrupalCon session I gave in Portland in 2013, only about half the room raised their hands when I asked how many had worked on a responsive Drupal site. This year, nearly everyone raised their hand when I asked the same question. <strong><em>At this point, responsive design is implicit when designing a new Drupal site.</em></strong></p>

<p>Here are some other design and UX trends from this year’s DrupalCon:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People are applying design thinking about much more than how a website looks.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/meganerinmiller">Megan Erin Miller</a>, a designer at Stanford University, gave a fantastic talk about using Service Design to design <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/designing-end-end-experiences-why-we-need-service-experience-design">end-to-end experiences</a>. According to Erin, “designing a website is not just about designing good user experience. It’s about designing new processes, new identities, and new partnerships.” I couldn’t agree more. Erin compared the process of building a website to designing a theme park. When you go to a theme park, your experience isn’t just about what happens when you ride the roller coaster. A good theme park experience starts when you see an ad on TV or get an email offer and book your trip online or over the phone. When you get to the theme park, your whole experience is planned and designed, from the moment you walk in the gate, to when you queue up in line for the roller coaster, and on to dining and buying souvenirs. As designers, we should be thinking of our websites as products and how our users interact with these products from all possible channels, and not just what browser they’re using on what device. I’m always looking for new perspectives for my personal design process, and I hope to use some service design techniques in my client work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Components, components, and more components!</strong> Just as the topic of “responsive design” dominated DrupalCon’s design sessions in years past, this year’s hot topic was component-based design. As websites and web apps get more complex and responsive, design needs to be streamlined and simplified. One way we can do that is to design modularly. Gone are the days of creating unique layouts for every page on a website (phew!). Instead, we need to be creating design systems that can be applied efficiently across the entire responsive website. Two great component-based design sessions from DrupalCon LA were, “<a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/new-design-workflow">The New Design Workflow</a>,” and “<a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/pattern-lab-collaboration-using-modular-design-principles">To The Pattern Lab!</a>” In addition to these sessions, I also attended a very informative BoF about CSS Style Guides lead by the one and only <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnAlbin">John Albin Wilkins</a>. At ThinkShout, we already take a component-based approach to design, but I certainly learned some great new ideas and techniques!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Longform Storytelling is the new black.</strong> As Drupal shifts its focus towards publishing and news, content creators are embracing <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/styles-storytelling-cultivating-compelling-long-form-content">rich longform articles and stories</a>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Bjoran_Identity">Kristina Bjoran</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/circlish">Courtney Clark</a> of Forum One, “People generally learn more and remember more when more of their senses are engaged by a story. Stories that include images get about twice the engagement as text-only stories. Stories told with visual elements are instantly captivating. The more senses that are engaged, the more emotions will be engaged and the more memorable the experience will be.” We are including longform content features in many of our new client’s websites at ThinkShout, and it was really great to hear how other industry leaders do it successfully as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="design-drupal-and-the-future">Design, Drupal, and the Future</h2>

<p>Each year, the Drupal Association puts more thought into diversifying the session lineup, and it shows. There was a very conscious effort to get more design and UX content, as well as speakers from diverse experiences and backgrounds. To that, I say “Huzzah!” As someone who’s been designing Drupal sites for many years now, it’s great to see the design process being treated as more than just “making it look pretty.” Design and UX is now a core component of DrupalCon, and I’m proud to have helped along the way.</p>

<p>After a week of learning and sharing new ideas, meeting amazing people, and eating some darn good Mexican food, my brain is full and my heart is heavy. I can’t wait to see you all next year!</p>
