  <title>Drupal Global Events in Portland</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>There are two exciting Drupal community events happening in Portland soon. The first is the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/489228">Drupal Global Sprint Day</a> on January 30th - this coming Saturday - which is a day focused on bringing together volunteers to contribute work such as documentation, testing, code, and design to the Drupal project. The project needs improvements from a wide variety of skill sets, and it’s a great way for new folks to contribute to Drupal. The second is <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/global-training-day-portland-oregon-february-2016">Drupal Global Training Day</a>, a free Drupal 8 training for new community members. We’re thrilled to be involved with both!</p>

<h2 id="drupal-global-sprint">Drupal Global Sprint</h2>

<blockquote>Bring your projects and come code with us!</blockquote>

<p>We’re hosting the Portland sprint <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2qjSPuVti6q">at our office</a>. Bring your projects and come code with us! If you’ve wanted to contribute to Drupal 8, but don’t know how to begin, we’re happy to help you get started. New contributors are encouraged to attend, as we will be providing sprint training and new contributor onboarding, so don’t worry if you’ve never contributed to Drupal before. The sprint starts at 9:00 am and goes until 5:00 pm. Programming help, snacks, coffee, tables, and wifi will all be provided by ThinkShout.</p>

<h3 id="drupal-8-training">Drupal 8 Training</h3>

<blockquote>These two global Drupal events offer something for Drupal folks of all skill levels</blockquote>

<p>February 6th is the Drupal Global Training Day. We will be leading the Portland training at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bX8fPX8Csmv">Drupal Association headquarters</a>, and it’s open to everyone. This free training is ideal for new community members and people who are new to Drupal – but PHP developers not familiar with Drupal should also find the training valuable. The training includes coffee and snacks. Participants need only bring a laptop. Everything you need to know to get started will be discussed in detail at the event. We’ll cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An introduction to CMS</li>
  <li>File management and databases</li>
  <li>Site building basics with content types, fields, and views</li>
  <li>Installation of modules and themes</li>
  <li>Deploying to your web host with Git</li>
  <li>Introduction to Drupal 8 theming with Twig templates</li>
  <li>Drupal 8 configuration management</li>
</ul>

<p>These two global Drupal events offer something for Drupal folks of all skill levels, helping us to tap into Portland’s strong Drupal community. I hope you’ll join us for either (or both!) of these great events.</p>
