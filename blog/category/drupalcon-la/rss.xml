  <title>DrupalCon LA - A Designer's Perspective</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Oh, man. After coming back from DrupalCon Los Angeles with my team at ThinkShout, my brain still hurts… but in a good way. You know, in that same way you feel after binge watching Dr. Who on Netflix leading up to the season finale where The Doctor and Clara… oops. No spoilers. Point being: it’s a feeling of intense brain explosion followed by inspiration and motivation to get up and kick some ass.</p>

<p>Besides attending some fantastic design and UX sessions, I also presented my own session about <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/ballin-budget-how-create-great-design-without-breaking-bank">designing on a budget</a> and led a BoF about design and prototyping in Drupal. I made a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/feliarex">awesome</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jessemutz">new</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ACFind">friends</a> and reconnected with <a href="https://twitter.com/deviantintegral">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/blakehall">old</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/makangus">ones</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kevishie">as</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jponch">well</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great conference and LA was a fantastic host city. My team from ThinkShout and I covered a lot of ground - we found some great bars and restaurants, including my favorite stop, Grand Central Market (where I had an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/joshriggs/status/598967276163829761">octopus tostada</a> from La Tostaderia).</p>

<p>But anyway, you’re not here to read about bars and restaurants in LA. Let’s talk Design at DrupalCon.</p>

<p>One thing that’s really impressed me about DrupalCon is just how much the breadth of UX and Design content has expanded over the last few years. This was my fourth DrupalCon: my first was 2011 in Chicago, followed by ‘13 in Portland and ‘14 in Austin. I was excited to see there were several sessions in the UX and Design track this year that were less technical, and more about design thinking and problem solving. Personally, I enjoy these kind of talks because I tend to walk away with some new insights into my own process. <strong><em>Design is not the same thing as Front End Development, and DrupalCon is finally realizing and embracing this.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="common-design-themes-from-drupalcon-la">Common Design Themes from DrupalCon LA</h2>

<p>Attending DrupalCon is a great way to get your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the Drupal community. I’ve noticed a lot of changing trends in the years since my first DrupalCon, starting with the prevalence of responsive design. In the first DrupalCon session I gave in Portland in 2013, only about half the room raised their hands when I asked how many had worked on a responsive Drupal site. This year, nearly everyone raised their hand when I asked the same question. <strong><em>At this point, responsive design is implicit when designing a new Drupal site.</em></strong></p>

<p>Here are some other design and UX trends from this year’s DrupalCon:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People are applying design thinking about much more than how a website looks.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/meganerinmiller">Megan Erin Miller</a>, a designer at Stanford University, gave a fantastic talk about using Service Design to design <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/designing-end-end-experiences-why-we-need-service-experience-design">end-to-end experiences</a>. According to Erin, “designing a website is not just about designing good user experience. It’s about designing new processes, new identities, and new partnerships.” I couldn’t agree more. Erin compared the process of building a website to designing a theme park. When you go to a theme park, your experience isn’t just about what happens when you ride the roller coaster. A good theme park experience starts when you see an ad on TV or get an email offer and book your trip online or over the phone. When you get to the theme park, your whole experience is planned and designed, from the moment you walk in the gate, to when you queue up in line for the roller coaster, and on to dining and buying souvenirs. As designers, we should be thinking of our websites as products and how our users interact with these products from all possible channels, and not just what browser they’re using on what device. I’m always looking for new perspectives for my personal design process, and I hope to use some service design techniques in my client work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Components, components, and more components!</strong> Just as the topic of “responsive design” dominated DrupalCon’s design sessions in years past, this year’s hot topic was component-based design. As websites and web apps get more complex and responsive, design needs to be streamlined and simplified. One way we can do that is to design modularly. Gone are the days of creating unique layouts for every page on a website (phew!). Instead, we need to be creating design systems that can be applied efficiently across the entire responsive website. Two great component-based design sessions from DrupalCon LA were, “<a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/new-design-workflow">The New Design Workflow</a>,” and “<a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/pattern-lab-collaboration-using-modular-design-principles">To The Pattern Lab!</a>” In addition to these sessions, I also attended a very informative BoF about CSS Style Guides lead by the one and only <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnAlbin">John Albin Wilkins</a>. At ThinkShout, we already take a component-based approach to design, but I certainly learned some great new ideas and techniques!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Longform Storytelling is the new black.</strong> As Drupal shifts its focus towards publishing and news, content creators are embracing <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/styles-storytelling-cultivating-compelling-long-form-content">rich longform articles and stories</a>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Bjoran_Identity">Kristina Bjoran</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/circlish">Courtney Clark</a> of Forum One, “People generally learn more and remember more when more of their senses are engaged by a story. Stories that include images get about twice the engagement as text-only stories. Stories told with visual elements are instantly captivating. The more senses that are engaged, the more emotions will be engaged and the more memorable the experience will be.” We are including longform content features in many of our new client’s websites at ThinkShout, and it was really great to hear how other industry leaders do it successfully as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="design-drupal-and-the-future">Design, Drupal, and the Future</h2>

<p>Each year, the Drupal Association puts more thought into diversifying the session lineup, and it shows. There was a very conscious effort to get more design and UX content, as well as speakers from diverse experiences and backgrounds. To that, I say “Huzzah!” As someone who’s been designing Drupal sites for many years now, it’s great to see the design process being treated as more than just “making it look pretty.” Design and UX is now a core component of DrupalCon, and I’m proud to have helped along the way.</p>

<p>After a week of learning and sharing new ideas, meeting amazing people, and eating some darn good Mexican food, my brain is full and my heart is heavy. I can’t wait to see you all next year!</p>

  <title>Committing to D8 Core - A Little Bit Goes a Long Way</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>It was the last day of DrupalCon LA and after a long week of sessions, getting to know fellow Drupalistas, and partying until the wee hours, I mustered what little brainpower I had left and made my way to the “First Timer’s Sprint.” Joined by my ThinkShout colleagues, Joe and Nancy, we arrived with beautiful visions of giving back to our community by contributing in some capacity to Drupal 8 core. And so it begins…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/image_1.jpg" alt="image_1.jpg" /></p>

<p>We arrived just in time to set our development environment up with a couple hundred other hopeful contributors, and were pleasantly surprised by how quickly that process went and how helpful the mentors were. As soon as we were all set up, the conference staff sent us on our merry way into the next room.</p>

<p>As you may or may not know, Drupal core is enormous! It can be a big, daunting pile of directories and folders that can go down several levels. For a newer developer (and even more seasoned ones, I hear) it takes a great deal of time to navigate this powerful platform. As a result, I was faced with too many possible issues to work on and very little background for how the contributing process works. I’m willing to bet most engineers have been in a similar situation at one time or another and can likely relate. This experience has a name - it’s called “decision fatigue,” where one is faced with so many possibilities to choose from that they become overwhelmed and may even check out entirely. I was there.</p>

<p>Having recognized this feeling before, I piped up and explained to our mentor that we would work more effectively if we were given a single focus or direction. This seemed to work well, and he provided us with a handful of suggestions. That was all fine and good, but after looking at the “Novice” queue, I felt my deer-in-headlights gaze only worsen. Still hungry for a way to gain some practical experience, I reflected back on the options our mentor suggested. He mentioned that “rerolls are easy,” and that seemed like a good place for me to start.</p>

<p>Seizing the moment, I nabbed the nearest mentor and asked him if he could spare a few minutes to help walk me through a reroll. Fortunately, he had a moment to spare, and pointed me to the documentation. Interestingly, this mentor happened to identify with me as a site-builder with little coding experience, yet he was knowledgeable and knew enough Git tricks to be an active participant in the Drupal issue queues.</p>

<p>With this mentor by my side, we dove into the oldest D8 “needs reroll” issue and went to town. Much to my surprise, this issue didn’t take long, but it also helped that another contributor had already rerolled the patch. No problem! I made a comment stating that the patch had been rerolled, how old the issue was (seven years, in this case), and removed the “needs reroll” tag from the issue. Though it felt like a negligible change, my mentor reassured me that I’d  spared another developer from having to go through the same process and reach the same conclusion. Consequently, the issue had moved on to a more progressive state, and there was much rejoicing.</p>

<p>After that was said and done, I went back to the issue queue feeling a tad more confident. Just moments later, our original mentor rushed excitedly back to our table. “Who wants to commit to core?” he asked. We all looked around at each other, not quite sure what to make of it, and responded with a cautiously optimistic “sure, we can help!”</p>

<p>Everything happened rather quickly, which was surprising considering how long it takes to get an average issue through the complete process. Here’s how it went down: There was an issue. A dev in another sprinting room was asked to write a patch. Another dev revised the patch by improving it slightly, and it was then passed to our table to go through the review process. A dev evaluation was put forth, then the issue was passed back for additional review. Finally, it was submitted to be pushed into core.</p>

<p>This was my first DrupalCon and, little did I know, they have a very important tradition - every DrupalCon sprint ends with a live commit by Dries, the founder of Drupal. Our team was lucky enough to be part of this ritual! So, after a full week of delightful Drupal-related shenanigans, I found myself on stage pressing the enter key on Dries’ computer to push our commit to D8 core. The button was pushed and the explosion of celebration and cheers from the audience was nearly deafening.</p>

<p>In this moment, I truly witnessed the heart of the Drupal community in action - this amazing tool could not exist without a number of developers carefully crafting code in accordance with Drupal best practices, and countless generous individuals attentively reviewing the proposed changes. It really does take a village, and the good news is that it doesn’t require being a coding genius to help out.</p>
