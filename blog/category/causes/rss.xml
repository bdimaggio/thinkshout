  <title>Young Survival Coalition site launched in time for Breast Cancer Awareness Month</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month, so the timing couldn’t be more right for ThinkShout to officially launch the Young Survival Coalition’s updated site. <a href="http://www.youngsurvival.org/">www.youngsurvival.org</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngsurvival.org/"><img src="http://www.youngsurvival.org/profiles/ysc/themes/survival/images/logo.gif" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>This past spring, YSC asked ThinkShout to take its existing, proprietary back-end and bring everything into Drupal. And because of the importance and high profile of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Breast_Cancer_Awareness_Month">Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a> it had to be done by October 1st.</p>

<p>Through our discovery process, we learned that YSC was happy with their existing site design, but needed a more flexible, scalable and user-friendly back-end solution, not just for staff but visitors and contributors as well.</p>

<p>We migrated hundreds of pages of YSC’s content, including more than <a href="http://www.youngsurvival.org/breast-cancer-in-young-women/learn/survivor-stories">150 survivor stories</a>. These powerful stories share the knowledge and inspiration of young women who have been affected by breast cancer, told in their own words.</p>

<p>“Please keep in mind that cancer hadn’t even come across my mind yet,” <a href="http://www.youngsurvival.org/survivor-stories/aimees-story-diagnosed-at-29">writes one young woman on the site</a> about an inconclusive mamogram.  “Oh sure, I told my husband that if it turned out to be cancer (which it couldn’t possibly be) that I would remove both of my breasts and everything would be hunky dory. Oh how wrong I was.”</p>

<p>In addition to survivor stories, YSC’s site is full of information about breast cancer in general, getting involved and volunteering, and one of the most extensive and useful <a href="http://www.youngsurvival.org/breast-cancer-in-young-women/faq">FAQs</a> about the subject we’ve seen in a long time.</p>

<p>ThinkShout is proud of all of our clients, and we value the work they do. This October, we’re especially proud of YSC.</p>
