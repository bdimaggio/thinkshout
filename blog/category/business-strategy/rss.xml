With the session submission deadline drawing to a close for <a href="http://portland2013.drupal.org">DrupalCon Portland 2013</a>, <a href="http://thinkshout.com">ThinkShout</a> (along with many other fine Drupal community members) participated in the mad rush to get all of our awesome session ideas in on time!  The DrupalCon session committee has a busy couple of weeks coming their way, and in the meantime, we’d love to hear your comments and feedback on our presentation ideas.</p>
