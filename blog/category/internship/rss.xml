  <title>The 2017 ThinkShout Summer Interns</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>In 2015, in partnership with the Drupal Association, we hosted our <a href="https://thinkshout.com/blog/2015/06/meet-the-interns/">first ever summer internship program</a>. It was an incredible experience, one we hoped to repeat.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce that this year, we are welcoming three interns to the ThinkShout family for the summer.</p>

<p>Two of our interns are joining us from the <a href="http://emergingleadersinternship.org/">Emerging Leaders Internship (ELI) program</a>, an organization committed to matching students from underrepresented communities with paid internships at top Portland companies. We’re thrilled to have this opportunity to provide these students with a chance to further develop their career skills.</p>

<p>This summer, they’ll be working on a campaign to benefit our neighbors at <a href="http://pearmentor.org">p:ear</a>, a Portland nonprofit that provides creative mentorship to homeless youth. They’ll get to use their design and engineering chops to build a brand new site from the ground up. We can’t wait to see what they come up with. We’ll keep you updated on their progress and share more about how <em>you</em> can get involved too, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Now let’s meet our interns.</p>

<h3 id="alejandro-meillon">Alejandro Meillon</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/alejandro.jpg" alt="alejandro.jpg" class="left thirty" /> Alejandro is our very first design intern! He’ll be working closely with our team to hone his web design skills on a variety of projects this summer. He’s fascinated by the power of the web and its many possibilites.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Planet</strong>: Neptune, since Neptune doesn’t seem quite so deadly to humans as the other planets.</p>

<p><strong>Preferred Superpower</strong>: The ability to stop time, like how Hermione’s time turner works in Harry Potter.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="myisha-kinberg-cowan">Myisha Kinberg-Cowan</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/myisha2.jpg" alt="myisha2.jpg" class="left thirty" /> Myisha is one of two interns joining our engineering team this summer. Her focus is back end development. She enjoys the challenge that coding provides and is looking forward to learning how to utilize open source technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Dream Trip</strong>: Haiti. I’m half Haitian, but I’m adopted and don’t know anything about the culture, and I’d like to know more about it.</p>

<p><strong>Preferred Superpower</strong>: I’d like to have the ability to remove hate from our society.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="katrina-hirsch">Katrina Hirsch</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/katrina.jpg" alt="katrina.jpg" class="left thirty" />Katrina has been coding for over twenty years and only just recently decided to change gears to make it a career. She’ll be focusing on front end engineering, and hopes to continue her journey toward mastering SaSS.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Planet</strong>: It’s not really a planet anymore, but Pluto. I like that it’s cold and dark, and it’s so small. I actually don’t know why I like those things about it.</p>

<p><strong>Dream Trip</strong>: Japan. I have a lot on my list, but that’s one that’s the most unique. I’d love to take a solo trip to Tokyo.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>We’re thrilled to be able to provide these three talented individuals with an opportunity to continue their education. We’ll update you on the cool projects they’ll be working on as the summer progresses — keep an eye out!</p>
