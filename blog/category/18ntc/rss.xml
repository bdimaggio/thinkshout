  <title>That's a wrap from New Orleans!</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>It feels like it was just yesterday… probably because we still have visions of beignets dancing in our head. But we had such a blast at 18NTC, and we have you, the nonprofit community to thank for it.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/NTC Beingets.jpg" alt="Booth Beingets" /></p>

<p>Our pre-conference Drupal Day was jam-packed with content from project management to content strategy, to <a href="https://thinkshout.com/bene/">Bene</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/Drupal Day.jpg" alt="Drupal Day booth" /></p>
<p><span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>Brett and Mimi take over registration!</span></p>

<p>Here were some highlights:</p>

<p><span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>Brett and Chris Carrol from University of Chicago Graham School definitely schooled us (sorry) on Content Strategy in Drupal.</span></p>

<p><span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>Lev shares a case study on Bene with the crowd. Bene is an open source distribution intended for small to medium-sized nonprofits. We have a whole page dedicated to it <a href="https://thinkshout.com/bene/">here</a>.</span></p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/Carie and Jess - Drupal Day.jpg" alt="Carie and Jessica talk redesign" /></p>
<p><span class="caption"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i>Jessica and Carie Lewis Carlson (formerly from the Humane Society of the United States) shared some wisdom on the challenges often faced in a redesign process.</span></p>

<p>We want to give a special shout out to our collaborators from <a href="https://www.gizra.com/">Gizra</a> and <a href="https://fionta.com/">Fionta</a> - who contributed to the breakout sessions – and to anyone who led a BOF (birds of a feather) breakout and conducted a lightning talk to close. We appreciate you adding your voice to the day.</p>

<p>Next year we’re especially excited about NTC because it’s happening right in our home town of Portland, Oregon! We’re eager to participate and contribute to the rich and vibrant nonprofit community that we deeply care about, and also show you some of what we love best about our hometown.</p>

<p>To stay up to date on everything pre-con / Drupal Day related, (or just to stay in touch!) <a href="https://thinkshout.com/contact/">sign up for our email list</a>. We’ll send a monthly newsletter with the latest trends and case studies to share…and as 19NTC approaches (too soon?) you’ll be first to hear about our plans and how you can join in the fun.</p>

<p>Below is the full agenda from Drupal Day 2018, please <a href="mailto:natania.leclerc@thinkshout.com">reach out</a> if you would like slides from any of the presentations. Thanks and see you all soon!</p>

  <title>ThinkShout hits all the conferences</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>It unfolded like a sitcom. You know, the one where someone promises two separate people to be their date to the dance at school. It’s gonna end badly for everyone.</p>

<p>Well, we saw it coming, and like the hero of that sitcom, we concocted an elaborate scheme to be in two places at once. Can we pull it off? Join us at DrupalCon and #18NTC to find out!</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/zackmorris.gif" alt="Zack Morris" /></p>

<h3 id="ntc">NTC</h3>

<p>We’re heading to New Orleans for a week of jam-packed nonprofit goodness. The fun kicks off on April 10th with a pre-con event, Drupal Day:</p>

<p class="center"><a href="http://ntcdrupalday.org/">Agenda Here!</a></p>

<p>We’re still  looking for lightning talk speakers so <a href="mailto:natania.leclerc@thinkshout.com">contact us</a> if you have a hot topic you want to share. Lightning talks are traditionally 5 minutes in length, and can cover any topic ranging from Drupal to nonprofit life to lessons learned and funny predicaments involving all of the above!</p>

<p>Brett Meyer and Jessica Tate will also be dropping some knowledge during the conference itself. Mark your calendars so you don’t miss their talks:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nten.org/ntc/program/sessions/supporting-diversity-with-multicultural-design/?mc_cid=997b26a472&amp;mc_eid=[UNIQID]">Supporting Culture with Multicultural Design</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nten.org/ntc/program/sessions/content-strategy-in-popular-culture-2/?mc_cid=997b26a472&amp;mc_eid=[UNIQID]">Content Strategy in Popular Culture</a></p>

<p>And no NTC would be complete without some ThinkShout classic tees! We’ll be handing out these beauties at our booth (number 606). We went with a 70s-inspired design this year, and they’ll give you all the posi-vibes you need.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/blog/TS2018-shirts.jpg" alt="ThinkShout 2018 shirts" /></p>

<h3 id="drupalcon">DrupalCon</h3>

<p>They said it couldn’t be done…so naturally we took on the challenge! A handful of our team will also be in Nashville for DrupalCon to learn about and contribute to the latest innovations in the Drupal ecosystem. As long-time supporters of Drupal, we felt it was important to continue to deepen our involvement and commitment to the open source community.</p>

<p>Join us for the <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/nonprofit-summit">Nonprofit Summit</a>, an interactive day of learning and networking with nonprofit leaders and Drupal experts. The summit features breakout sessions on a variety of topics – including a case study presented by Gabe Carleton-Barnes on <a href="https://thinkshout.com/bene/">Bene</a>, the distribution we released this winter. Don’t miss it!</p>

<p>We’re also sponsoring a <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/women-drupal">Women in Drupal</a> event on April 10th. All women, transgender individuals, those who identify outside of the gender binary, and allies are welcome. Our goal is to foster inclusivity and embrace the involvement of individuals across the gender spectrum. We’ll be handing out those same tees at both events, so be sure to show up early and grab yours while supplies last!</p>

<p>All joking about conference logistics aside, we truly appreciate every opportunity to connect with the nonprofit tech community. It’s a chance to hear more about the inspiring work being done in the world. If you’d like to sit with us and talk about what we can do for your digital presence, <a href="mailto:hello@thinkshout.com">let us know</a>, we look forward to hearing from you!</p>
