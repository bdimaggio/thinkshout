  <title>How to Deal with a Small Design Budget</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p><em>Originally Published by <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/small-design-budget/">InVision</a> on July 2, 2015</em></p>

<p>“I want my website to look like Apple.”</p>

<p>Ever heard a client say something like that during the early phase of a project?</p>

<p>What most people don’t realize is that companies like Apple employ huge design teams that work with nearly unlimited resources.</p>

<p>I spent several years working on these kinds of teams, never having to worry too much about budget. Now I work solely with progressive non-profit organizations that need to stick to a strict budget.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean the design has to suffer. Here are 5 things to keep in mind when you’re designing on a budget.</p>

<p><strong>1.  Focus on what you can do instead of what you can’t</strong></p>

<p>Even if you don’t have a team of 100 designers like Facebook, or the resources to create your own custom design framework like <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb</a>, you can still have amazing, creative ideas.</p>

<p>When time or budget is limited, I start out by clearly defining my limitations. And then I think critically about how I can creatively work around those limitations. Most of the time I’m able to create a solution that’s more innovative and useful than if I’d been given free reign.</p>

<p>No matter your budget, focus on these things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>User needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good typography and color palettes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And you’ll design a good product.</p>

<p><strong>2. Don’t underestimate the implementation of your design work</strong></p>

<p>As designers, we need to know how our work impacts the entire development process—not just the budget we’ve set aside for design. I used to think that a minimal visual design equalled a simple design implementation by developers. As I got more experience, I realized that was wrong.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I wanted to add an expanding search box into the header of a responsive Drupal site we were creating at ThinkShout. It took me 2 minutes to design in Sketch, and maybe another 4 to find the code for the exact same interaction I wanted on <a href="http://codepen.io/912lab/pen/LsplC">codepen</a>.</p>

<p>So if it took me 6 minutes to design and find code, it must be easy for our front-end team to implement, right?</p>

<p>It took 1 of our front-end engineers 3 hours to theme in Drupal, largely because the expanding search interaction I wanted was so different than Drupal’s default search module.</p>

<p>Aside from spending years becoming an expert programmer, the best thing you can do to understand how your work impacts the rest of the development process is to be in constant communication with developers.</p>

<p>If I’m not sure about an idea or concept, I’ll ask a developer something like this: “On a scale of 1 to 10, how hard will it be to build this?”</p>

<p>Any higher than 5, and I change my idea.</p>

<p><strong>3. Be consistent</strong></p>

<p>When you’re building an app or website, inconsistency in design wastes time. Eliminate unnecessary, confusing, back-and-forth communication by making sure text headings, button styles, and image aspect ratios are all consistent throughout your design system.</p>

<p>For example, using several different image aspect ratios, like square for avatars, 16:9 for news stories, and maybe a 2.35:1 for very cinematic hero images might look awesome. But if your website is being built on a CMS like Drupal, someone will need to set up all those parameters in the back end—and that takes time to configure.</p>

<p>By simply deciding on a standard image aspect ratio of 16:9, you’ve cut the image configuration time by 2/3. And the overall design aesthetic won’t suffer a bit.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ballin_0.png" alt="ballin_0" /></p>

<p><em>The wireframe on the left has 3 different aspect ratios for news images, and the wireframe on the right has 1 standard aspect ratio.</em></p>

<p>The best way that I’ve found to keep my work consistent: with a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">component-based design approach</a>, and using <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/documentation/05-text/3-text-styles.html">Text Styles</a> and <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/support/documentation/07-symbols/">Symbols</a> when designing in Sketch.</p>

<p><strong>4. Focus on objectives, not deliverables or tools</strong></p>

<p>Design deliverables have to make both clients and developers happy. This isn’t easy—it’s a balancing act between creating enough work to properly inform the client, while also giving developers everything they need to do their jobs. Clients would love to see every possible page and interaction mocked up in high-fidelity at every break point with multiple variations. But most developers want you to give them an HTML and Sass component style guide and call it a day.</p>

<p>The reality: when you’re working with a limited design budget, you have to find a way to meet them both in the middle.</p>

<p>For me, having a solid design process is more effective than working through a checklist of specific deliverables. While the deliverables I work on and the tools I use vary greatly depending on the client—static or HTML wireframes, design in the browser, design in Sketch, style tiles, style guides, etc.—I actually have a pretty simple process. I always start broad before working down to the details. Style tiles before high-fidelity mockups. Sketching before coding up prototypes. Horse before the cart, and plenty of feedback in between.</p>

<p>With this kind of design process, independent from tools or deliverables, I can quickly and effectively adapt to any budget. How we think is more important than the tools we use to create.</p>

<p><strong>5. Communicate early and often</strong></p>

<p>Bad communication can be like a wrecking ball to your budget. On every project I’ve worked on, communication has been the deciding factor of success or failure.</p>

<p>It’s also been the main reason why a project comes in under or over budget.</p>

<p>So why does bad communication cost us?</p>

<p>Simple: assumptions cost money. Some examples of assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Something’s technically easy to implement when it’s actually not</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The client wants 1 thing when they really want something else</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can come back later and fix or tweak a feature</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Part of a good design process involves removing assumptions. When we assume instead of communicate, problems snowball. A little assumption in the beginning of the project can lead to big delays or hot fixes once we’re knee-deep in development. And as we all know, it’s much easier to change a wireframe than it is to change a feature in a deployed feature on a live website.</p>

<p>A typical web design project usually looks like the graphic below. Strategy, UX and visual design, and development all happen in large blocks of time, 1 after another. And in between these phases exist massive walls over which deliverables are thrown to the next person or group without much of an attempt at collaboration.</p>

<p>Besides being a bad environment for creating a great product, this can be a mega budget killer.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ballin_1.png" alt="ballin_1" /></p>

<p>The biggest problem with this kind of work environment is that it allows no room for us to iterate and solve problems as they arise. When we’re dealing with really complex content-managed websites, getting clarity can take weeks or months.</p>

<p>No matter how thorough we are with our UX and design, there’s always something that comes up in the development phase that needs our attention. Sometimes clients need change. Sometimes we just didn’t consider something, or we were just plain wrong.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ballin_2.png" alt="ballin_2" /></p>

<p>A better process: remove those walls we talked about earlier. If we rearrange our timeline so that design, strategy, and development happen somewhat simultaneously, and everyone communicates with each other along the way, there’s far less room for assumptions and miscommunications to rear their ugly heads.</p>

<p>Maybe you can’t completely change your company’s process, but you can at least start planning to save some of your design hours for the development and implementation phase of the project. Don’t be afraid to ask for clarity. Move your desk to sit next to an engineer if you have to.</p>

<p><em>“Every artist confronts a series of issues that are constraints. Those constraints are then turned by the artist into a positive force…”</em></p>

<p>–Frank Gehry</p>

<p>Working backwards from a budget doesn’t mean your design has to suffer. Use constraints as a challenge to be more creative and focus on delivering the core goals as elegantly as possible.</p>

  <title>DrupalCon LA - A Designer's Perspective</title>
  <description>
    <![CDATA[<p>Oh, man. After coming back from DrupalCon Los Angeles with my team at ThinkShout, my brain still hurts… but in a good way. You know, in that same way you feel after binge watching Dr. Who on Netflix leading up to the season finale where The Doctor and Clara… oops. No spoilers. Point being: it’s a feeling of intense brain explosion followed by inspiration and motivation to get up and kick some ass.</p>

<p>Besides attending some fantastic design and UX sessions, I also presented my own session about <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/ballin-budget-how-create-great-design-without-breaking-bank">designing on a budget</a> and led a BoF about design and prototyping in Drupal. I made a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/feliarex">awesome</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jessemutz">new</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ACFind">friends</a> and reconnected with <a href="https://twitter.com/deviantintegral">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/blakehall">old</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/makangus">ones</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/kevishie">as</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jponch">well</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great conference and LA was a fantastic host city. My team from ThinkShout and I covered a lot of ground - we found some great bars and restaurants, including my favorite stop, Grand Central Market (where I had an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/joshriggs/status/598967276163829761">octopus tostada</a> from La Tostaderia).</p>

<p>But anyway, you’re not here to read about bars and restaurants in LA. Let’s talk Design at DrupalCon.</p>

<p>One thing that’s really impressed me about DrupalCon is just how much the breadth of UX and Design content has expanded over the last few years. This was my fourth DrupalCon: my first was 2011 in Chicago, followed by ‘13 in Portland and ‘14 in Austin. I was excited to see there were several sessions in the UX and Design track this year that were less technical, and more about design thinking and problem solving. Personally, I enjoy these kind of talks because I tend to walk away with some new insights into my own process. <strong><em>Design is not the same thing as Front End Development, and DrupalCon is finally realizing and embracing this.</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/design_notes.jpg" alt="design_notes.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="common-design-themes-from-drupalcon-la">Common Design Themes from DrupalCon LA</h2>

<p>Attending DrupalCon is a great way to get your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the Drupal community. I’ve noticed a lot of changing trends in the years since my first DrupalCon, starting with the prevalence of responsive design. In the first DrupalCon session I gave in Portland in 2013, only about half the room raised their hands when I asked how many had worked on a responsive Drupal site. This year, nearly everyone raised their hand when I asked the same question. <strong><em>At this point, responsive design is implicit when designing a new Drupal site.</em></strong></p>

<p>Here are some other design and UX trends from this year’s DrupalCon:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>People are applying design thinking about much more than how a website looks.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/meganerinmiller">Megan Erin Miller</a>, a designer at Stanford University, gave a fantastic talk about using Service Design to design <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/designing-end-end-experiences-why-we-need-service-experience-design">end-to-end experiences</a>. According to Erin, “designing a website is not just about designing good user experience. It’s about designing new processes, new identities, and new partnerships.” I couldn’t agree more. Erin compared the process of building a website to designing a theme park. When you go to a theme park, your experience isn’t just about what happens when you ride the roller coaster. A good theme park experience starts when you see an ad on TV or get an email offer and book your trip online or over the phone. When you get to the theme park, your whole experience is planned and designed, from the moment you walk in the gate, to when you queue up in line for the roller coaster, and on to dining and buying souvenirs. As designers, we should be thinking of our websites as products and how our users interact with these products from all possible channels, and not just what browser they’re using on what device. I’m always looking for new perspectives for my personal design process, and I hope to use some service design techniques in my client work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Components, components, and more components!</strong> Just as the topic of “responsive design” dominated DrupalCon’s design sessions in years past, this year’s hot topic was component-based design. As websites and web apps get more complex and responsive, design needs to be streamlined and simplified. One way we can do that is to design modularly. Gone are the days of creating unique layouts for every page on a website (phew!). Instead, we need to be creating design systems that can be applied efficiently across the entire responsive website. Two great component-based design sessions from DrupalCon LA were, “<a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/new-design-workflow">The New Design Workflow</a>,” and “<a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/pattern-lab-collaboration-using-modular-design-principles">To The Pattern Lab!</a>” In addition to these sessions, I also attended a very informative BoF about CSS Style Guides lead by the one and only <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnAlbin">John Albin Wilkins</a>. At ThinkShout, we already take a component-based approach to design, but I certainly learned some great new ideas and techniques!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Longform Storytelling is the new black.</strong> As Drupal shifts its focus towards publishing and news, content creators are embracing <a href="https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/styles-storytelling-cultivating-compelling-long-form-content">rich longform articles and stories</a>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Bjoran_Identity">Kristina Bjoran</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/circlish">Courtney Clark</a> of Forum One, “People generally learn more and remember more when more of their senses are engaged by a story. Stories that include images get about twice the engagement as text-only stories. Stories told with visual elements are instantly captivating. The more senses that are engaged, the more emotions will be engaged and the more memorable the experience will be.” We are including longform content features in many of our new client’s websites at ThinkShout, and it was really great to hear how other industry leaders do it successfully as well.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="design-drupal-and-the-future">Design, Drupal, and the Future</h2>

<p>Each year, the Drupal Association puts more thought into diversifying the session lineup, and it shows. There was a very conscious effort to get more design and UX content, as well as speakers from diverse experiences and backgrounds. To that, I say “Huzzah!” As someone who’s been designing Drupal sites for many years now, it’s great to see the design process being treated as more than just “making it look pretty.” Design and UX is now a core component of DrupalCon, and I’m proud to have helped along the way.</p>

<p>After a week of learning and sharing new ideas, meeting amazing people, and eating some darn good Mexican food, my brain is full and my heart is heavy. I can’t wait to see you all next year!</p>
