<section class="body">
  <p><strong>Three years ago this week,</strong> Lev and I biked over to our attorney’s office in downtown Portland to sign the incorporation papers that founded ThinkShout, Inc. Afterwards, we headed over to our local bank and each deposited $500 into a shared checking account to pay our first month’s rent on two small desks in an incubator space at the <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/">EcoTrust</a> building.</p>

<p>Those first two months of 2011, it was just the two of us, arguing and laughing and generally annoying the heck out of the other start-ups in our space. Lev wrote all the code. I configured Drupal websites and sliced up Photoshop files into CSS.</p>

<p>At that time, we had a handful of awesome local clients that put up with our scrappy approach. Don’t get me wrong, we built some great websites and released some incredible Drupal modules to the community that first quarter - but as a consultancy, we had some rough edges. Our capacity for graphic design was minimal. The first time that I closed a 20-hour discovery and information architecture contract, I thought that we’d really made it. <em>(In contrast, strategy and user experience now make up a third of our business).</em></p>

<p>Our hearts were in the right place, yet Lev and I made a ton of mistakes back then (still do). We put in a lot of hours and worried ourselves and our loved ones to sleep more than a few nights. I thank Marti, Lev’s wife, almost as much as I do him for investing in our early efforts.</p>

<p>Within a few months, we were able to bring on our first full-time employees. Needless to say, we then made even more mistakes as new bosses (still do). And we thank our staff much more than ourselves for investing in the company’s continued growth.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only thing that has stayed the same at ThinkShout since that first week in January 2011 is our team’s shared belief that <em>nonprofits benefit exponentially from their investment in open source tools.</em></p>

<p>Slowly, we have distilled the following vision for our business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Invest in the most talented team members possible;</li>
  <li>Choose to work with clients that make the world a better place;</li>
  <li>Don’t compromise on tools, process, or quality;</li>
  <li>Work hard, have fun, and give back.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So here we are now, a three-year-old company.</strong></p>

<p>2013 was a big year for us. We moved to a beautiful new office. We brought on 17 new clients. We doubled the size of our team. This growth, coupled with new efficiencies spearheaded by our Director of Professional Services, Betsy Ensley, has allowed us to increase our project capacity by 180 percent.</p>

<p>More important than our growth, we’ve just become a lot better at serving our clients. We are launching much larger, more complex web applications on time and on budget. We have completely redefined our estimation process and have included many more formal budget checks during both discovery and implementation. We have restructured our development workflow around weekly demos to narrow feedback loops and bring the development team closer to the clients they’re helping. Our clients are happy and our team is proud.</p>

<p>Speaking of pride, over 22,000 Drupal websites now run on code that we’ve written and that our clients have collaboratively sponsored. What a cool statistic!</p>

<p>In addition to deepening our expertise as an open source engineering team this year, we have broadened our services to include user experience consulting, content strategy, and engagement metrics planning. As user experience designers, we completed our first non-Drupal UX engagement for Mercy Corps. As strategists, we’ve helped a number of organizations build and measure engagement strategies that turn website visitors into donors and activists.</p>

<p>As business owners, Lev and I have hopefully grown a little bit too. This year, we made a significant time and financial investment into leadership development and management coaching. To our peers in this technology space, we couldn’t recommend this investment more highly.</p>

<p>The biggest thing that we’ve learned as owners (and I say “learned” acknowledging that it’s something that we continue to fail at more than we would like) is to trust, let go, and get out of the way of the incredibly intelligent, creative, and passionate team that we’re fortunate to be a part of.</p>

<p><strong>Looking ahead to 2014 we have many goals.</strong> Early in 2014, we have a few <a href="http://thinkshout.com/careers/">clutch positions</a> to fill. We will look to continue to hone our skills, polish our approach, and solidify our processes. We look forward to providing our clients with additional “value added” offerings such as content and online fundraising strategy. With the upcoming release of Drupal 8 and other exciting open source technologies, we can’t wait to innovate with our clients this year.</p>
