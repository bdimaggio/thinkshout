  <p>Well, we’re at it again…our team is growing as we take on more and more exciting Drupal web application development projects. ThinkShout is looking to hire both a <strong>senior Drupal engineer</strong> and a <strong>site-builder with project management skills</strong>.</p>

<p>Are you passionate about Drupal web application development? Do you want to be paid to make significant contributions to the open source community? Do you want to go to sleep each night proud of the clients you serve? Are you looking for an employer who will invest in your professional development? Are you looking for a cool geek community with a great location in an awesome progressive town? Do you enjoy organic burritos and acupuncture (both available downstairs from our office). Do you want you want to take your dog to work? Do you want to help choose the Spotify playlists we listen to in the office?</p>

<p><a href="http://thinkshout.com/team">Lev, Andrea, Brandon and I</a> care about these things too - and, in large part, that’s why we think that we’ve become such a successful team in just the two short years that we’ve been working together. Now we’re looking to grow the team. Given our commitment to remaining a lean, “high-end, do-good” shop, you are invited to help us iterate on the culture and best practices you’ve always wanted on a development team.</p>

<h2 id="more-about-us">More About Us</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We work exclusively with progressive organizations in the for-profit, non-profit, and government space. (Sorry, no big corporate or entertainment industry gigs that make you want to cut off your fingers.)</li>
  <li>We have strict engineering standards. We review each other’s code. We write code as if every line will be seen by outside eyes (so yeah, a lot of code comments are expected).</li>
  <li><em>Abstraction, abstraction, abstraction</em> - We like to partner with our clients to release cool tools. In fact, most of the Drupal modules we’ve released were budgeted into billable client projects.</li>
  <li>We don’t really care about computer science degrees. We care a ton about self-study.</li>
  <li>We try to keep work to 40 hours per week. But let’s face it, the talented folks with whom we all like to work are generally reading and working on personal geek projects after hours and sometimes on the weekends. It’s not a requirement, just that sort of our culture.</li>
  <li>While we are developing a product or two, we’re first and foremost a services company - and as such, we have to track our time closely. All staff have pretty strict billable hours requirements (lower than other shops in town, but still focused). If you’re not comfortable helping the team remain productive and getting projects done on time and on budget - it’s probably not a great fit.</li>
  <li>We value communication skills over genius. (Let’s face it, we’re a small team of passionate technologists, we gotta be able to talk through challenges and opportunities.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-you-you-dreamboat-you">About You (You, dreamboat, you)</h2>

  <li>You have an interest in working with new, emergent web technologies (such as Node JS).</li>
  <li>You’re a self-starter; you care about your development tools; you stay on top of new technologies and development best practices.</li>
  <li>You don’t mind getting your hands dirty (Let’s face it, we’d all like to write module code all the time, but there’s always going to be a good amount of configuration management with Drupal gigs.)</li>
  <li><strong>You are able to work on-site at our offices in Portland, Oregon.</strong> (Please pay attention to this point - while we are flexible regarding office hours, you are expected to work on-site most of the time.)</li>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t worry about writing us a formal cover letter or prepping a fancy resume. (If you have one, send it along - but we want to start a conversation first and foremost.)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Do send us an <a href="mailto:info@thinkshout.com">email</a> telling us about yourself and clearly providing the following information:  <em>(Seriously, please provide the info below if you would like us to get back in touch with you.)</em></p>
  </li>

  <li>A list of open source conferences you have attended, as well as user groups you have frequented.</li>
  <li>Confirmation that you understand that this is a full-time, salaried, on-site position. (Sorry to beat on this one, but you know how responses to these job postings go…)</li>
  <li>A description of your development workflow (What’s your local dev environment? What tools you use? How do you go about solving development problems? Etc.)</li>
  <li>An answer to this question: If you had to choose one object (other than your laptop) to keep in your team’s space, what would it be?</li>
  <li>And finally, questions for us. Interviewing is a two-way street. What do you want to know about us? What do you want out of a team?</li>
</ul>

<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
